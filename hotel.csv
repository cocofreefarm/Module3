0,4,1,"Our room on the second floor was very nice. The decor is Victorian, from the furniture to the color palette, even down to the little octagonal black and white tiles in the bathroom. There was a lovely fireplace, and the toilet tank was mounted by the ceiling with a pull chain to flush.
There was a small sitting area and full sink, countertop and mini fridge, a full sized coffee maker and a small flat screen TV. The mattress was comfortable, the towels were soft and there was good water pressure in the shower.
We stayed in the winter and the room was toasty warm.
From our room you could hear the traffic noise, especially due to the wet roads, and the room is above a bar. From the bathroom we could hear distant voices, maybe from the bar or from an adjoining room, but it wasn't a problem. I could hear people walking in their room on third floor a couple of times.
The thing that was a surprise as far as noise were the trains that went through in the wee hours of the morning. We had arrived after dark and didn't notice that a railway crossing was right outside our window one story down, and at least twice trains went by and blew their horns a few toots as they passed the intersection.
We had some drinks, including complimentary ones for our stay, at the Up North, and the bartender told us we could take drinks and popcorn up to the room if we would like.

1,3,0,"This hotel has good intentions.   The service was adequate.  The room was clean.  The vintage decor of this place does not resonate with me.  I don't get it. ..it just looks outdated...but not in a fashionable way ...just in a we're going to grandma's house kinda way...In fact, after having stayed the weekend here, im sarting to wonder if all the 4  & 5 star reviews i read beforehand about the vintage charm of the hotel are even real.   

The breakfast at the Come Back In was the real deal.  The buttermilk pancakes were a little bland, the pan fried potatoes were tasty but greasy but, even with that said, breakfast being included as part of the hotel  pkg is definitely a huge plus.

3,3,5,"Ok, so I chose this place because I love old, and quirky, and full of history and kindness, and in all these aspects I was not disappointed. This lovely creepy cool old hotel was perfectly clean and there were little shared porches, and the bed was comfy, and the bathroom was recently renovated, and the long blood red hallways were hung with vintage photos of horrifyingly judgmental looking Victorians. All of this I enjoy a great deal. The staff were all super nice. 

Where it all broke down for me was first, the noise. It sounded like ghosts were cranking machines in all the walls of my bedroom and the machines were full of water and rusty metal and crumbling cement, and it happened all night while the heat swooped from sweaty hot to icy hand of death cold. On the second day I was there the wifi went down, and I weirdly couldn't get phone calls or texts as well, and when I tried to call the front desk the phone in my room didn't work. 

I chalk this all up to ghosts and history and character, and it wasn't a huge problem, but I'd hesitate before I chose this place again. I loved the location across from the lake and I loved the fresh free pastries downstairs, and I loved the sweet dive bar attached to the hotel. I'm so torn.

It's quiet at night so you can get some quality sleep, and the beds are super comfortable.

It's location is great-far enough from the nightlife of downtown that you don't hear street noise, but close enough that you can walk to fantastic bars and restaurants. An added bonus is the local bar connected to the Ruby Marie. They had a great band while we were there. And there's a sand volleyball court right outside by the (free) parking lot.

10,5,4,"The Expectations: Hotel Ruby Marie was everything I hoped for, plus more. I expected a fun, memorable stay in a kitschy hotel in Madison, and it came with a friendly staff and goddamn delicious complimentary food.

The Reservation: Super easy. We waited until the last second to make plans. Called on Friday mid-morning and made reservations for that night with no problem. I don't know if online reservations are available - it said ""no rooms available"" online so we called to see, and of course there was vacancy.

The Location: The hotel was very easy to find. We took the highway into town and knew where/what we were looking for: a gorgeous red building at the corner of Wilson and Blair. About a 4-5 minute walk from the Majestic and the Capitol.

Parking: We got there around 7pm. Parking was a little difficult in the lot by Essen Haus and Come Back In because it was the dinner rush but we just waited for someone from the restaurants to leave, took about 5-10 minutes. We were able to leave our car there the next day after check-out, just needed to tell the front desk that we'd be leaving it there for the day.

Check-in: We warned them we were checking in late and they told us we'd get our keys from the barkeep in the Up North Saloon on the 1st floor. It was crowded but he attended to us quickly and professionally.

The Bar: Our free drink vouchers (1 per guest) were good during happy hour 3-7pm and they let us use them at 7:30 so we grabbed a quick drink before heading out. Later in the night, we went back to the Up North Saloon to meet a friend, had beer and a little pizza around 11 pm. 

The Room: We paid for the cheapest room available, at $150 after taxes, and had a wonderful view of the lake. Everything was clean, the bed was nice, the bathroom had modern furnishings and the shower was very nice (it had one of those giant shower heads). The building had some creaks and groans throughout the night like an old building would and it wasn't bothersome. I don't think there were many other guests because I didn't hear anyone else in the hotel.

The Staff: Laid back and unobtrusive. I don't think they'd have free toothpaste for you or stuff like that that you'd find at a big chain hotel so you just need to manage your expectations. The front desk is closed at night but checking in and out was easy and we had no other problems. It seemed like a do-your-own-thing kind of place, like you're renting an apartment room for the evening and the landlord isn't going to be there to hold your hand.

The Perks: The free drink vouchers were a nice touch but more importantly, we got a complimentary meal at the Come Back In the next morning. You order whatever you want off the menu. That means a steak & egg and skillet breakfasts with wheat toast and potatoes, an orange juice, an apple juice, and a bloody mary with a chaser. For FREE. The friendly server didn't even bring us an itemized bill, she just let us know that gratuity wasn't included in the voucher.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to other Madison visitors.",Hotel Ruby Marie,524 E Wilson St,53703,4.0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'""}","Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services"
11,1,2,"My girlfriend and I stayed her a couple of weekends ago. Unfortunately this hotel gets 1 star due to their lack of customer service. After we checked out of the hotel and were on our way to the airport, my girlfriend realized she left her dress hanging in the closet. We called immediately and they said they found the dress and would mail it out and they would charge my card. A few days later I called to confirm, because I had not seen the charge on my credit card and we hadn't received the dress. The dress just disappeared and that employee no longer worked there. It was an expensive dress and I feel cambria should reimburse us, at least partially for our stay, but they took no responsibility and offered us nothing.

14,5,0,"Our stay at the historic Hotel Ruby Marie in Madison, WI was a fantastic experience all around. The staff, location, and accommodations were ideal.

The most striking feature of this hotel is the atmosphere. The Hotel Ruby Marie is a beautifully maintained 150 year old building, and the history is palpable. From the lobby, through the corridors, to the rooms the property if full of elegance and charm. Historic photos hang on the wall, and the hallways are lined with beautiful antiques.

The rooms are similarly appointed. Comfortable, homey, with a notable touch of class. The bed was very comfortable, The bathroom was large and great for two people getting ready in the morning. 

An especially nice feature of the Hotel Ruby Marie, were the added bar and restaurant on-site. On the first floor is a delightful pastry shop/deli, which hosts the complimentary hotel breakfast every morning. Delicious sweet and savory pastries and coffee are available. They also offer sandwiches and wraps later in the day. 

Located around the back of the property is a quaint and quirky tavern. They had live music the night we arrived and it was a wonderful place to unwind at the end of our night. They offer a variety of local beers and tasty cocktails at a much better price point than you'd find at many hotel bars.

I was in town performing at the Majestic, which was about a 5 minute walk from Hotel Ruby Marie.

I would rather have stayed at the latter, but it's been booked up for my two trips here. My first review I gave this place 2 stars. I was trying to throw 'em a bone.

Now, I take back one star, and if I could take back two, I would. The reason is: insects. This place needs pest control. I was sitting on the bed surfing the internet, when out of the corner of my eye I saw something crawling up the power cord towards me. I freaked out. It was some kind of beetle or box-elder bug looking thing. I killed it but was paranoid the whole night and couldn't go to bed until 1:30 AM. Just the thought of more of them hanging around somewhere made me anxious.

In the morning I left to go to my training and when I came back at the end of the day I was hyper-aware of anything and everything on the floor, walls and ceilings. When I went to the bathroom I spotted another insect. It was a silver-wiry looking one. I think it was a silver fish. I wasn't able to kill it because then it crawled into a tiny little crack at the corner of the wall. DANG IT.

54,4,4,"My sister in law planned an overnight stay in Madison and at her suggestion we checked in at the Ruby Marie. My husband and I opted for a premium room because we wanted the jacuzzi, and with the fireplace it just sounded so cozy. We all arrived early since we were going to a local show and the person at the desk, Dylan or John, I'm not sure, was nice enough to let us check in before the scheduled time. The price of the room ($160 + taxes came about to $183) included two drink vouches at the Up North and a breakfast voucher for two at the Come Back In. The room itself was really nice. The bed was very comfortable, the jacuzzi was a pretty decent size, and the fireplace gave the room a really nice atmosphere. Really, the biggest negative experience of our stay there was getting our free drinks at the bar. When we checked in we were told the 3pm-7pm happy hour on the voucher was more of a suggestion than a rule. After we got back we went straight to the Up North around 7:10, not long after the show finished. The bartender seemed drunk and was acting really obnoxious. I asked for a bloody mary and the bartender's response was ""Seriously? I just put everything away."" and he seemed so annoyed at my request. He made a few sarcastic/rude comments while making my drink too, and I've never had someone make me feel like such an inconvenience all because I ordered one drink. My sister in law asked for a bourbon and coke and he gave her a bourbon and WATER and they had to ask for a coke on the side. Afterwards we went to Essen Haus, but that's another review entirely. The jets in our jacuzzi also didn't work, but after calling the front desk in the morning they gave us a partial refund. I was a little disappointed, but because they did what they could, I can't really fault them for that. Breakfast at the Come Back In ended up being one of the biggest highlights of our stay, at least for me it was. With the voucher we were able to get prime rib and eggs and two bloody marys. The prime rib was cooked very nicely, with the eggs and pan style potatoes it was definitely a filling meal. Easily a step up from the usual muffins/waffles that most hotels offer as a complimentary breakfast. Our tab came out to $6 with the extra bloody marys we ordered.

Check in time is 3PM but we were in the area at 1PM and stopped in.  We were told our room was ready and given the keys.  We did not actually go to the room because we had a few errands to run, plus my husband has Parkinson's Disease and it is too difficult to keep coming in and out.  When we came back at 3:45 we went to our room to discovered it was never cleaned.  Dylan at the front desk kind of blamed us because we arrived before his shift and therefore he thought the room was cleaned.  We asked for another room, but they were sold out.  He told us to come back in 30-45 minutes because he had to personally clean the room since his housekeeping staff had left for the day.  We returned in 45 minutes went into the room and turned a lamp on which blew a circuit in the room.  We went back to the desk and Dylan said that the bathroom lights work so don't worry - even though nothing in the actual room worked - television, clock, fireplace.  (Fireplace did not work at all.) He called someone to figure out the issue.  He did give us a small credit. We were leaving for a very early dinner reservation and the people above our room were noisy. We hoped when we returned it would get better.  We came back about 8:15 and the noise was loud - talking, music and constant walking around the room.  The inn is very old and the floors from above really creak - a lot!  Went back to Dylan to complain and he said he hoped that they would go out for the night.  They did for about hour.  At 10:30-11:00 the noise was so loud - this time singing, music and the loud creaking of the floor was unbearable.  Dylan was gone for the night and the instructions said to call the bar downstairs.  I called the bar they picked up the phone and put it down.  I called back but the phone was busy because they just laid it down.  The noise, now singing, creaking kept going on - we have not slept yet.  Finally, at 2PM I called the Innkeeper who was not happy and said he would be over in 20 minutes.   At 3:30 nothing - the noise including more creaking now included them filling up the whirlpool tub and getting into it.  We left at 3:45AM and drove 2 hours home - this was difficult because with my husband having Parkinson's through his body schedule off.  Great get away weekend, Hotel Ruby Marie.  I called the Innkeeper the next morning for a full refund and he said he normally does not like giving refunds but would make an exception.

73,4,3,"This place rocks! I visit Madison a few times a year and have stayed at the majority of the hotels in the downtown area. The one place I haven't stayed at and wanted to, until this past weekend, was Hotel Ruby Marie. So happy with the choice. 

Hotel Ruby Marie is located in walking distance from the Capital Building and across the way from Lake Monona. Couldn't ask for a better location. The hotel is basically its own block. Attached to the Hotel is well-known and fabulous restaurant called the Essen Haus. Additionally, they have a little pub and corner restaurant attached to it. During your stay you get 2 free drink passes per day to the pub and free breakfast to the restaurant. 

To me, what sets this place apart from most of the other Madison hotels is value and comfort. I loved the fact that they have their own parking lot. Many of the Madison downtown hotels don't provide that, and if they do, its not free like Hotel Ruby Marie. The rooms are easily on par with the pricer places downtown. Rooms are spacious, beds are comfy and service is very accommodating. Then on top of that, you get free food and drinks!

75,2,3,"The Hotel Ruby Marie is a former neighborhood blight that was carefully restored to its original charm. If you like staying in unique places -- or hate staying in institutional hotels -- then this might be the place for you. A one bedroom was about $149 before taxes, so this was more on the high end for hotels that you might be able to find. 

The good
------------
The location is easy walking distance to the capital and a number of great hotels.
There is lots of free parking
The hotel itself does have unique decor. 
The wifi works great. 
The staff is very friendly. I saw no issues with the service. It was excellent. 
Hotel is clean. Bathroom/hot water/etc has no issues.

The bad
-----------
If you have noise issues, then this is really not the hotel for you. Two sides of the building face busy roads. Although the hotel was nicely renovated, it was not soundproofed. If you are placed on the side with the lake view, you can see a lake, but you mostly see traffic. This also includes train tracks about 40 feet from the building and a very loud train came by at 12:30 am and again at 6 am. You will also constantly hear cars, buses, trucks. 

Some people just don't have noise issues, so this isn't a problem. Another solution is to ask to be placed in other part of the building (this wasn't an option for me because the hotel was full, but you might request these when you book). Several rooms, I believe, look into a small internal courtyard, so have no view, but are possibly quiet. Other rooms overlook the parking lot, and are probably quieter. 

After one night I checked out. They were very gracious about it. I mention the noise because it was a problem for me, especially after traveling. For you, maybe this just isn't an issue.

Would stay again if I got a good rate but with so many other options nearby in this price range I wouldn't recommend.  On previous visits stayed at the Marriott, Fairfield and Hilton Garden Inn, all were much nicer for same price or cheaper.

Front desk service was friendly and quick.  
Remodel was nice and fresh.
Good location to beauty line adds shopping on the west side. 
Room was clean and free of bugs.  

Now for the Opportunities:
I'm an early riser and apparently many others as well during my stay.  As I work in the lounge I can't tell you how many people are looking for breakfast before 7 am, front desk will guide you towards McDonald's because there breakfast bar doesn't open till after 7.  Hardly practical for early risers or for those here on business.  
Rooms are smaller than those stated above.   With luggage for three it was difficult to navigate from within.  Not much for throw down space. 
I was very disappointed how dirty the common areas were in the morning.  You think first thing these areas would have been refreshed over night for morning use.  Trying to find a clean spot to lay my computer was difficult without first cleaning of someone else's crumbs or debris.  Pictures show the cleanest spot.
Lastly, I enjoy a relaxing shower in the morning to start my day... The experience here was anything but, I thought my skin was going to peel off due to the high pressure and laser focus of the shower head.  That coupled with only on bar of soap for both sink and shower doesn't work for those with multiple people per room.

Unacceptable, especially when here for work.

They obviously weren't empty...very frustrating, especially when here in winter without a car.

Also, the restaurant has the tendency to close for private events. This really got me. They know that a lot of their guests are here without transportation so I don't know how this could stand.

98,2,0,"Stayed here in April for a University of Wisconsin sporting football game. Hotel was clearly recently remodeled and at first look was very nice.  Would stay again if I got a good rate but with so many other options nearby in this price range I wouldn't recommend.  On previous visits stayed at the Marriott, Fairfield and Hilton Garden Inn, all were much nicer for same price or cheaper.  

On the plus side:
1. Front desk service was friendly and quick.  

2. Remodel was nice and fresh.

3. Good location to belt line and shopping on the west side. 

4. Room was clean and free of bugs.  

Now for the Opportunities:
1. I'm an early riser and apparently many others as well during my stay.  As I work in the lounge I can't tell you how many people are looking for breakfast before 7 am, front desk will guide you towards McDonald's because there breakfast bar doesn't open till after 7.  Hardly practical for early risers or for those here on business.  

 2. Rooms are smaller than those stated above.   With luggage for three it was difficult to navigate from within.  Not much for throw down space. 

3. I was very disappointed how dirty the common areas were at 6am in the morning.  You think first thing these areas would have been refreshed over night for morning use.  Trying to find a clean spot to lay my computer was difficult without first cleaning of someone else's crumbs or debris.  Pictures show the cleanest spot.

4. Sleep number beds are like sleeping in an air mattress.  Maybe for camping but not for a hotel.  

5. Lastly, I enjoy a relaxing shower in the morning to start my day... The experience here was anything but, I thought my skin was going to peel off due to the high pressure and laser focus of the shower head.  That coupled with only on bar of soap for both sink and shower doesn't work for those with multiple people per room.  

Too bad, this place had a good first impression which is typically the expensive part.

100,4,0,"I stayed at the Hotel Ruby Marie for two nights about a year ago.  I stumbled upon their website when trying to find a a room in a hotel that was not part of a national chain for my first ever trip to Madison.  I's SO happy I chose to stay here.  This hotel and building has so much character and charm, it's like no 'National Name' Hotel I've ever stayed in.

We arrived very late, about 11 PM, after the front desk was closed.  They arranged to have me pickup my room keys in the bar, which was no problem at all.  It was a little loud in there, but the bartender was super nice and helpful.

Our room was adorable and looked like it was straight out of 1910, except for the TV, phone, and electricity.  We chose a lake view room, and a word of warning for light sleepers:  there is a busy freight train line that runs about 50 feet from the front of the building (between the building and the lake).  I read about this from previous reviews, so I wasn't surprised when a freight train woke me up the first night at 3 AM blowing its horn.  This happened again the second night.  I didn't really mind; I just went back to sleep.  If you are a very light sleeper, though, ask for a room that faces the parking lot on the back of the building.

Positives: great location--very close to the state capital, lakefront, restaurant & bar downstairs (with free breakfast on weekends for hotel guests), most of downtown Madison is within walking distance, super charming, friendly & helpful staff.

Negatives: The busy freight train line at the doorstep, but the hotel can't really do anything about that.",Hotel Ruby Marie,524 E Wilson St,53703,4.0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'""}","Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services"

I've stayed at this inn on several business occasions over the last 5 years because of the super clean and well-appointed rooms, great breakfast, nice parking, convenient location to Capital and University.  But now I Yelp because of the superior service by their staff! 

 Last month my family had several rooms because of my daughter's graduation from the UW.  On Sunday morning, the day of the ceremony, there was a huge snow storm, causing my best plans for an afternoon party to go awry in addition to transportation hassles.  John not only offered to call a taxi service but stayed on the line holding for almost 15 minutes to arrange a ride.  But that is not all he did!   He very generously allowed me to use some of their service space to prepare for the party I had planned later that day at another location!  He gave me some towels and use of electric outlets, all after I had checked out and went to the graduation!  We came back and he monitored it all for me. Talk about going above and beyond.  What an AWESOME experience of customer service.

That's done now. Last night we had a room on the main floor and could hear everything that was going on outside. Birds, traffic, late night bar patrons. Worse though, was the noise inside the hotel. Lots of loud drunk guests slamming doors and congregating in the hallway after midnight. Recent changes at the hotel give you no one to call about this as well. There is no longer an after hours inn keeper and the hotel info directs you to call the bar downstairs if you need anything. Considering the bar likely helped to put our neighbors into their current state, I wasn't confident that they would be able to resolve the issue. Also, the bed and pillows were incredibly uncomfortable. All this ended with us packing up and heading back to Chicago at 1:45am after listening to the noise for a couple hours.

119,4,9,"Hotel Ruby Marie was the delightful little hotel we stayed at during an overnight trip to Madison. 

It's not big enough to be called a hotel, and it's too large to be called a bed and breakfast, so I would classify it as an inn. If you look up the word 'quaint' in the dictionary, I'm pretty sure you'd find a picture of the Hotel Ruby Marie next to the listing. 

The rooms are charming. We managed to get a corner room which had a fireplace and a separate sitting area. The bed was quite comfortable and the shower and jacuzzi had great water pressure. Those are non-negotiables for me, and Ruby Marie passed with flying colors. 

The inn also houses a couple bars and restaurants, all of which were casual and laid-back. Continental breakfast on weekdays and full breakfast on the weekends is included in the room price, as are two free drink coupons, and free parking. 

My only gripe is that their wi-fi was frightfully slow. We had to look up directions to a few places and it took forever for the maps to load. It was only a mild inconvenience since we weren't intending on spending an inordinate amount of time glued to the computer, but if you're one of those people that needs to stay connected 24/7, you may find this annoying. 

I wouldn't hesitate to go back to the Hotel Ruby Marie. If you prefer old-world charm to a boring, nondescript hotel chain, you should definitely consider staying here.

122,4,2,"I was part of a group that went to the Great Taste of the Midwest. We made reservations for Saturday night here.  Based on our experience, we'll probably use this hotel again in the future. 

The staff here was fantastic! We arrived early on Saturday morning around 9:30 AM. We were hoping to be able to check in and put our luggage in our rooms before heading to the Great Taste. Shannon at the front desk was able to get us checked in and into our rooms, even though normally check in isn't until 1:00 PM. We had pre-arranged a shuttle to take us to a local brewery where we could catch another shuttle to the park where Great Taste is held. Due to an issue, the shuttle from the hotel was late getting to us and we missed the shuttle from the Brewery to the park. Even though the park was outside the range they normally go, they took us directly to the park and even made arrangements to pick us up when it was over. 

The rooms and the common areas of the hotel where clean. The pool and hot tub were nice, one of my friends thought the temperature on the hot tub was a little too hot and another thought the chlorine in the pool was a bit on the strong side.  The only problem I had with the physicality of this hotel is the parking. For a hotel this size, there was surprising little parking. I know they had events going on in some of their banquet rooms, modeling auditions during the day, a wedding in the evening. As a hotel guest, I should not have to hunt for a parking spot AT the hotel I'm registered and then end up having to park at a neighboring business because there were no spaces available at all. This happened to us twice. Once when we arrived, and then later in the evening after we left to go to dinner. 

The rooms had sleep number beds in them. I was kind of excited about this as I had wanted to try one to see what they are like. Unfortunately for me, there were no instructions on how to use it, and then there was the problem that my bed was broken. I couldn't change the number, but I didn't find this out until late in the evening and I was ready to just go to sleep. My bed was hard as a rock. I couldn't read the display, but I swear that it was set at the number that was equivalent to concrete. The shower in our room was nice. I will tell you that they have some serious water pressure. If for some reason you are adverse to using soap, no worries... the water coming out of the shower head will not only blast the dirt off of you, but it will also exfoliate you as well! For the record, I find this to be a good thing. 

The complimentary hot breakfast they serve in the morning is okay. Sunday morning we had Eggs, sausage, waffles, toast, cold cereal, fruit, OJ, coffee and milk. Nothing really to be all that excited about. But it was free and for free you can't complain. Just be wary of the shirtless guy coming from the pool to get his breakfast.

Ie we got a room package that included ""chocolates"" and ended up getting a beautifully decorated platter of chocolate-covered strawberries. The Radisson Madison KILLS it. 10/10 would recommend.

One aside if any Radisson managers happen to be reading this, we got room service for breakfast and a 20% gratuity as well as a room service/delivery charge was included. This seemed a bit odd because I still wanted to personally tip the person who brought the food to us (it's never clear if they actually see those ""included tips"") so id recommend not automatically including gratuity in a room service bill.

128,4,5,"I'm going to cheat here and add my opinion about the whole spaß platz experience because that's what makes this place AND I'm too lazy to review each place individually.  Sue me.

Anyway, I ended up staying at Hotel Ruby Marie because it was the best of both worlds...My partner in crime somehow finds B&B's quaint and charming and I am a hotel girl all the way.  Hotel Ruby Marie is a little of both.  It is small and charming (and even has an innkeeper!) like a B&B, but it is big enough to be considered a hotel.  No sleeping in grandma's guestroom and having breakfast with the other people you overheard doing god knows what last night.  Bonus.  It also has three other places attached to it to make it an awesome (and responsibly drunk, perhaps) experience:  The Up North Bar, The Essen Haus, and The Come Back In.  First of all, you get two free drinks during happy hour at the bar (which is just downstairs of the hotel) AND you get a free breakfast coupon for The Come Back In with your stay.  The Essen Haus is the only part of the spaß platz experience that doesn't give you a freebie...oh well.

Each place has its charms and drawbacks, but I suppose it depends on your personality as to whether you will love or hate each part.

I must say, the hotel was cool.  It was creepy and quaint at the same time.  You get a huge room (if you pay for it!) with old school charm that is very different than any hotel you will stay in.  That part I liked.  I also liked the bonus perks of the coupons too.  The only drawbacks really are the terrible pillows, the loud ass trains and cars, and the old school heating which may keep you up all night if you are a light sleeper or someone who has to pee based on power of suggestion (or in this case, power of dripping/running water through old pipes).  And there's no hair dryer in the room, FYI, but they do offer other amenities and toiletries so you're not completely out of luck.   

Now for the bonuses:  The bar is part of the hotel, so you could mosey on down there whenever and go back and forth to your room if need be.  (You know...to change, go to the bathroom if you don't want to use the bar one, or to do whatever else your little heart desires.)  It was small, townyish, and had a good list of Wisconsin craft beers at a decent price.  Do what you will with that.  The Essen Haus is right next door and it has the typical German restaurant flair (ridiculous uniforms, polka band, decent German food, das boot, etc.).  I thought it was a little pricey, but if you like that scene, it's definitely worth stopping in.  At least for a beer (or 4).  Last, The Come Back In is next to Essen Haus and has a really good breakfast and a random collectible charm (and is even better when it's FREE!).",Hotel Ruby Marie,524 E Wilson St,53703,4.0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'""}","Bed & Breakfast, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services"

136,4,4,"Great place to support if you're into locally owned places with character. However, even though this place looks like a cute B+B it's lacking most of the warmth of one; despite being lovingly renovated it seemed like kind of an absentee management situation. The front desk guy was helpful enough I guess but the desk is only staffed limited hours (after hour check in is handled by the bar downstairs). But the prices are really good and if you're not a needy person who needs a staffed front desk 24/7 this is an awesome, non-corporate place. The rooms are much nicer than they appear on the hotel website and ours was clean and quite large, despite being the cheapest one.  Only downside was that the TV was blurry. Some of the rooms face down into an atrium area off the bar on the 1st floor- this might be noisy during warmer months but was fine while we were here. Location is perfect- very close to the lake and quick walk over to the capitol.  

Some perks when you stay here: They give you 2 drink cards per person per night at the bar downstairs. Breakfast on weekends, which we didn't experience, is at a nice attached cafe and you can order whatever you want. Weekday breakfast is at the bakery downstairs and features mediocre pastries and cereal. Such a weird little bakery with no customers!  Plenty of free parking and they let us check in early and also leave our car an extra few hours after check out. Parking at the nearby Hilton is $13-18/night in comparison.

137,4,4,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Ruby Marie for a weekend getaway to Madison.  It's a cute little Bed and Breakfast that's been around since the 1880's.  

Our room was really cute.  Comfortable bed, huge bathroom, fridge (with complimentary juice and beer!), TV, closet, you name it.  The hotel itself does not provide a ton of services and the innkeeper leaves at 7pm, so if you're a high maintenance traveler, I would avoid this place.

The thing we liked best about this hotel was its proximity to downtown.  We were only a few blocks from State Street, the downtown bars and brewpubs, and we were right above 3 awesome bars.  (I can stumble home from the Essen Haus?  Yes please.)  The breakfast comes from the Come On In two doors down, and there were a lot of tasty choices.  

The only reason I'm docking one star?  This hotel is right next to a train line, and 3-4 freight trains a night come through.

When we questioned the front desk, they apologized and said yes there was somebody else that went into that room by mistake and they must've laid down in the bed.   

Today is a fairly hot and humid day, and the halls smell like armpits.

We went out for dinner and we came back we attempted to turn the air conditioner down to make the room more comfortable only to find that the air-conditioner did not work.

150,3,1,"I am a huge fan of B&B's, especially those of the vintage and Victorian variety, so naturally when I was researching places to stay for my brief Madison getaway, Hotel Ruby Marie definitely caught my eye!  It's so charming and well maintained for a building of its age!  It's not a cookie-cutter-corporate hotel.  And compared to the hotels in the surrounding area, it's a bargain to stay for one night! 

My check-in and check-out interactions went smoothly and were very pleasant.  The room was tidy and I appreciated the small details--a secretary desk for addressing a few quick post cards to pals, a vintage feel to the toilet--a high placed tank and long chain for flushing, and of course a tub with Jacuzzi jets which came in handy for unwinding after my evening exploration!  Other pros include:  the free drink vouchers for happy hour at the Up North Bar (which in itself is a real gem--a fine and interesting mix of pleasant folks, live music in the evenings, great bar tenders), the location of the hotel downtown (it was just a few minutes walk to breathtaking scenery by the lake, fine dining, and the venue of the concert I was attending later in the evening) and in-room fridges (which had complimentary water but were otherwise empty, leaving plenty of room for leftovers--I hate when the fridge is packed with mini-bar options and leaves no room for items you may bring back to the room/have brought with you).

There are just a handful of cons though; nothing was a big enough deal-breaker that I wouldn't stay again, but I would like to make note of them.  Previous reviewers have mentioned the noise issue:  depending on where you're located in the hotel, it is possible to hear noise from the Up North Bar and their nightly musical guests; I could hear them when traveling about the hotel but not from my room.  What I COULD hear from my room (which faced the lakeside) were the trains as the tracks practically run right below your window.  It was difficult to sleep uninterrupted, particularly around 3 am as that seems to be prime time for train travel through this area.  I'd advise some earplugs if you find yourself in one of these rooms.  Also, when I booked my room a month or so ago, I was delighted to hear that I'd be staying in a lakeside room, but as you'll note in the photos accompanying this review, the view is more of the traffic surrounding the hotel than the lake.  I came to Madison to explore though, not to laze about in my room and unwind, so I wasn't super bummed about the view, but I definitely wouldn't make it sound like a treat to staying in the room I occupied.   My biggest gripe was the breakfast.  I've stayed in many a B&B and breakfast is the star of the show, usually.  Not so with the Ruby Marie.  It's more continental style, rather than made-to-order and it was mostly baked goods and cereal and under-ripe fruit.  I had high hopes for the savory pastries as they appeared to be the only warm options, but it was obvious they'd been reheated and not thoroughly.  After a raucous night of concert going and then staying up in the Up North Bar, I definitely would have appreciated tucking into something warmer and substantial (though I guess late night shenanigans aren't on the ticket for most week-day guests but hey...).

To make a long story short, I'll definitely be back if I find myself in Madison again, just maybe with some ear plugs in hand and alternative breakfast plans...

152,5,1,"In short: delightful boutique hotel with quirky European feel. I stayed here for two nights  and would happily go back.

You enter via a small lobby from the parking lot, then step into an elevator that takes forever to get from ground level to the first floor, then picks up speed and whisks you to the lobby on the second floor. You step out into a beautifully decorated, wide corridor. ""Wow!"" you think, ""Someone has really put a lot of work into making this place beautiful.""

Experience: the front desk agent who greeted me was helpful and pleasant-- he even remembered me calling in for a reservation several weeks earlier.

My third-floor room was just a bit on the small side if you are used to cookie-cutter chain properties, but it had everything I needed, including fridge and kitchen sink. All the amenities were there, mattress was firm and comfortable, etc, etc. Nice breakfast provided at  a café in the same building.

Kudos to the housekeepers, too- everything was spotless.

Did I mention the corridors? Maze-like, but that was part of the place's charm. And the decorations? Oh my! I'm a business-like guy, but really, for a fun getaway, you can't beat this joint.

Another departure from chain-property practice: there is no night staff coverage. Instead, the manager leaves his home phone number.

Only caution: there is a very noisy bar on the first floor of the building. The sound level was painful when the elevator door opened on that floor, but I did not hear a peep from my third-floor room. You might want to consider this when you make your reservation. Also, I note that another reviewer complained about trains passing by - yes, there is a railroad track across the street from the hotel.

So I proceeded to grab all my bags, lug them back down hallway after hallway after hallway back to the lobby to request a nonsmoking room. Thankfully I was put at in a room that wasn't a country mile away this time. 

The restaurant is, in a word, boring. I did the complimentary breakfast buffet. Yawn-worthy scrambled eggs, lukewarm french toast sticks, uninspired cereal choices. You get the picture.  A better idea? Grab a latte and bagel down the street at Victor Allen's coffee shop.

The breakfast buffet is larger than many and some of the selections changed daily to provide some variety. 

The negatives:  The pool is tiny - about the same size as the hot tub.  You are definitely not going to swim any laps in there.  There is no true restaurant and the food the bar offered was really bad (my 'chicken fingers' were reheated frozen nuggets and my salad had two ingredients - tomatoes and spinach). To add insult to injury, they don't even offer room service!  You have to go pick it up from the bar.

It may not be a typical five star experience kind of place and it truly may only be five stars to me because I like staying in places that I think are:

a) possibly haunted
b) possibly decorated with furniture and photos from the turn of the (20th) century
c) run by some of the nicest people around

I stayed in a gargantuan room for a very reasonable rate. Not only did I have a king size bed, I had a heart shaped jacuzzi tub that I could almost swim in and a little dining area. Breakfast was even included! (Not in my room though, it was in a common area.)

We were told by the valet parking attendant that there were no longer any parking spaces available at the garage. I had to unload my tired kids and luggage at the entrance of the garage (no one offered to help me unload or to bring me a luggage rack for my bags) while my husband was directed to park at a lot across the street. He was assured by the valet parking attendant that we could park there. He pulled into the garage and was promptly told he had to back out, as the garage was full. He then called the hotel and was told to park at a bank's parking lot around the corner. My husband was concerned because the lot said it was only for M&T customers, but they told him it was fine to use it because it was a holiday weekend. My poor husband then had to walk back to the hotel while we waited in line to check in. The elevators were broken, but eventually one of them worked. Upon checking into our room, it was immediately obvious that no one had cleaned the bathroom. There was old urine on the toilet seat and blonde hairs on the sink. I asked a cleaning lady in the hallway for clorox wipes and she said she'd ""see what she could do."" When no one came back after about a 1/2 hour, my husband called down to the hotel lobby and someone came up about 15 mins later with cleaning supplies so that we could clean the toilet properly. 
This was a terrible experience, but it gets worse!
The next morning, when we walked back to the car around the corner with our luggage and two young kids, we discovered that the parking garage we parked in was locked! Thankfully we were able to call the security for the bank and they were kind enough to let us in/out of the parking garage.

DoubleTree in Madison might as well present you with a slap in the face at check-in to show how uncaring and shady they are.  During my two night visit, I would have rated them much differently as the hotel was great and so was the service.  My 3 year old son was with me in my hotel room and on the second night he had a sudden stomachache and threw up on the comforter.  Mind you, it covered less than a 6"" x 6"" area, and consisted of nothing highly stainable, such as red Koolaid.

I felt terrible about the incident, but the comforter was nowhere near ruined.  In fact, a good wash in the washing machine would have cleared it right up.  Even if that didn't do the trick, a bit of bleach could have been applied and all would have been saved.

I expected a modest cleaning fee to be tacked on to my credit card for the trouble.

I found out days after my stay, that I was charged $150 to replace a comforter.  So instead of washing a perfectly good comforter, DoubleTree of Madison threw it out!  I can't believe that those comforters cost $150, but if they truly are, I also can't believe they would just throw out a $150 comforter.

I called and politely explained my situation to the woman at the front desk, the woman in billing, a Manager by the name of Anthony, and the GM, Tom Ziarnik.  All, but the GM, were helpful but unable to credit my account.  The GM was able to credit my account, but was not willing to, helpful, or caring.  I've also contacted their corporate customer support, who have made no effort in getting in contact with me for the past week.

*UPDATE (3/27/2013)*  I got in contact with someone at the corporate office.  They were very sympathetic with my specific situation and were willing to refund the charge.

Nestled roughly less than a mile from the Capitol building, it's quite ideal actually. Not too busy, and not too far from the action either. A walk around the outside premises foretells what the neighborhood will be after a year or two due to all the new development.   
This hotel is clean, it's pretty and it's updated. The lobby has a fresh and open feel. It has elevators to take you to all the other floors where your rooms are located. There's beds in the room, a tv, a bathroom, a desk, they even have decorations on the walls...   that's amazing!!! Their fitness center is really nice and complete. It has cardiovascular equipments, big giant bouncy balls, weights and wall full of mirrors to watch yourself flex while lifting heavy stuff.   

The pool area was a bit in an odd spot, it's situated by the rear parking structure, so you would have to use the stairs to get there. It's a bit out of the way, BUT it's a good thing since this deters some people from going, so you end up with the pool mostly all to yourself.   

If there is nothing good going on outside, your hotel is a place for refuge and solitude. That's when the amenities come in handy. But if you're in a happening spot like here in Madison, a hotel is pretty much a place for you to put your head down. A spot to pass out after whole day of awesome adventures.

206,1,0,The crown plaza on the outside appears nice and lobby with pool view is amazing. We were greeted with a warm smile and some general accommodation the hotel had. When we get to the floor we are staying on it was uncomfortably warm and our room temperature wasn't any better and the smell of the room was musty at best.  After a call to the front desk asking for a room change we were told there were no rooms available but we would get the first one tomorrow. So after realizing we were going to have to tough it out for the night I go into the bathroom to find the toilet doesn't flush unless you hold the handle down and peeling paint on the ceiling of the shower. The following morning we ask about our room change and get a story that the hotel is booked up and can't change rooms. I go about my day and get back to the hotel about 630pm and am approached on my way in by a homeless person who was staying behind the hotel asking for money. When I get to the room i find the room has not yet been cleaned. Once again we complain with nothing being done. Finally about 730pm the maid asks if she can clean. The following morning we talked to the manager and threaten to change hotels and she seemed perfectly fine with losing our business. We did some searching and couldn't find another option so we are stuck with the hotel. About lunch time on the third day I get an email from my credit card company that the hotel charged my card for the full 8 night stay after 3 days.

208,5,0,"I had the absolute pleasure of staying at this hotel this week for business. I have stayed at Doubletrees over the years and always had a fine experience but nothing outstanding. Typical for a chain except you get the delicious cookie!

This week was different. I walked into the door to several smiling faces. All ready to check me in. Rob who was ""jack of all trades"" immediately provided assistance with our bags, where to park and then later gave myself and a colleague a ride to a restaurant. 

Not only was the service absolutely perfect but so was the room. Two nice big queen beds. Nice size bathroom. Apparently the rooms were recently renovated and kudos to the architect! This was the first time I had the perfect shower. I don't care for the ones like in the Westins I believe that have the shower head on the ceiling or over your head...who wants to get their hair wet unless you are washing it? In this shower you walked in and simple to use faucets were right in front of you and to the left was the shower head. What was beautiful about that was the ease of use of the faucet and having it located not under the shower head where you have to dash to not get wet. So simple but I have never see it before. That was really great.

The room was also fully functional. There were plenty of well-located electrical plugs. I didn't have to bend down every which way trying to find ones that I needed. They had them in the wall, by the bed, etc. 

When I checked out I was sharing my experience with the front desk and said the only thing that would have been perfect was if there was water in the room. And the young lady responded, ""oh didn't you know there were two in the refrigerator?"" I said ""no""! I was promptly provided with a bottle to take with me. Adjacent to the hotel is a sports bar a convenient location for a meal and drink. However if you want to go into ""town"" which is literally 5 minutes away Rob or Mohammad are pleased to take you and pick you up!

210,2,1,"The price for a 2 bed room with a TV, radio, desk, and lounge chair is  over $125 per night (no fridge, no microwave). The appearance of the room is not pleasant (peeling wallpaper, poor paint, visible water damage in the room). The room appears to have last been updated prior to my birth (1980's). Upon arrival, a housekeeper was notified that the lamp in our room did not work. She replied that she would call downstairs to send someone up. Nobody came.  Four hours later, I found a maintenance worker myself who immediately came to the room and replaced the lamp. There is no fan in the bathroom, but that's not much of an issue because there isn't much steam since the water only gets lukewarm at best. On 4-21-14, at 3:44am I was unpleasantly shocked awake by a very loud alarm somewhere in the hall outside my room. I later found out that it was thought to be due to a dirty smoke detector. That increased my confidence in the overall cleanliness of the facility. On 4-22-14, I was appalled that a housekeeper walked into the room without even knocking. That was very frightening to hear a key card clicking in my door when I didn't have any guests!  There are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning. If you don't get one of those, you'll have to pay ten dollars for a mediocre breakfast bar. 

This part deserves it's own paragraph. The smell of this facility is that of an angry, unbathed gladiator suffering the heat of a Roman sun mixed with the excretions of baby post-sweet potato. You've been warned. The air handling is so terrible, I truly cannot warn you enough. I am not able to hold my breath long enough to tolerate the stench. Particularly worrisome is that the stink is worst in a stairwell. If the dirty smoke detectors ever went of with warning of impending doom, that doom may be more so from the stairwell stink (remember not to play in elevators during a fire!) than the fire.

223,1,1,"I really never do reviews but this place was just so bad that I don't want other people to make the same mistake.  Stayed here for my brother's wedding.  The lobby is updated but that is it concerning any updates in the last few decades.  All the walls, paint, and floors desperately need replacing.  Even the freaking trash cans in the elevator lobbies look like somebody dented the hell out of them.  How hard is it to replace that? It's ridiculous how in need of maintenance this place is.   The walls look like the cleaning crew just runs their carts along the walls every day to chip away paint.

The rooms are severely dated, missing paint and stains on the carpet everywhere.  The bathroom fan didn't work and there was black mold above the tube probably as a result of the fan.  The place just felt extremely grimy, I would not recommend it to anybody. 

To top it off, my parents had left their new shoes for the wedding at the front desk over night and somebody (employee) stole them...  So they had to quickly buy new shoes the morning of the wedding.  

Then on the morning that we are leaving, which is the night after the wedding.  We get a constant knock on our door at 8am.  It's the staff asking when we are leaving so they can clean the room.  Like come on, normal check out is 11am, don't go around waking people up in the early morning to kick them out.

228,4,0,"This is a very well run hotel and I would certainly stay here again if in the city. The only reason I'm not giving it a five is because I think 200+ a night is a bit overpriced, but I booked about 7 days before my trip. The customer service in this hotel is perfect. The hotel shuttle picked me up from the airport and was really fast. It took maybe 15 minutes to get to the hotel. As soon as I walked in, I was offered cookies while I waited in line. Following maybe a 2 minute wait, I checked in to my room and was placed on the Hilton Honors floor since I'm a reward member. Although this hotel only has 7 floors, it designates the top 3 as Hilton Honors. 

From a convenience standpoint, this hotel is also ideal. I had business in the Engineering Building on campus, and it was about a 15 minute walk. The capital and downtown were about a 5-10 minute walk. None of the streets felt shady and there were always pedestrians. Even when I took a run at about 7:15, the streets were relatively busy. 

The only inconvenience at this hotel is the morning shuttle begins at 7:00am, so if you have an early flight you have to schedule a cab. The staff was really nice to check the shuttle log to see if I could ride to the airport with a flight crew, but the times didn't align.

229,3,4,"If I could do 2.5 stars I would.

I pricelined this hotel in Madison and felt that it looked like a great place.  I  then read the reviews and I fretted the entire time before we arrived.  Luckily when we got there it wasn't as bad as I had anticipated.  The lobby is beautiful, the pool area is very nice, the pool was very large too.

The room was just ok.  I hate that they only have double beds or one king bed as bed options.  But, we were traveling with a two year old so the double beds worked as one of us slept with our son while the other got a bed to themselves.  The beds were not super comfortable, they felt like they had been around for quite some time. Our room had been remodeled but the wallpaper was peeling from the walls already.  I can promise that is because there is a serious humidity issue in this hotel.  Our room was CONSTANTLY damp.  We turned the air down to 68, we tried warmer, but to no avail, it just stayed damp.  When you laid your head on the pillow it felt damp.  The bad thing about this is we were staying here four days.  Our swimming suits never dried out the entire time we stayed at this hotel.  They ask that you turn off the AC when you leave the room and turn it back on when you return.  I refused to do that with the humidity issues that were present and yet the maid service turned our AC off two days we were there.  

There is a Starbucks in the hotel, but, I never once saw it open.  The pool area was lovely, but, it was quite cold when you initially got in, but once acclimated it was okay.  The hot tub was very hot.

231,5,0,"Literally one of the best hotels Experience I've ever had. The rooms wasn't the biggest but does it really have to be? I will bore you with the entire story to justify my wonderful rating. 

I flew into Madison for a business meeting in Janesville wi. The original plan was to rent a car and drive to my normal hotel on Janesville. However the Avis rental guy changed those plans.  So instead of a impromptu MMA main event I elected to stay in Madison and catch a ride with one of my company's VPs. This hotel was in route so it worked out. 

I called last minutes and they had a room available. The front desk ladies recognized my country accent from the phone call and I had keys to a room in a less than a minute. I also had 2 very warm chocolate cookies. Doesn't sound like much but after losing all of my testosterone with Avis  guy this was needed.  

The price of the room was a little steep however I didn't push for any company discounts or deals since it was last minute. The room was small but like I stated earlier It didn't matter.  Well I refuse to say it was small I will use a very commonly use term in real estate "" it was cozy"". The bathroom was nice so I will lot complain.  

Room had plenty of extras such as water, trail mix and coffee in the room. Plus I had a perfect view of the university of Wisconsin campus. I was thinking that this place would be flooded with drunk college kids but I was wrong.

232,5,0,"We got a large block of rooms from the Double Tree for our wedding. Most of our guest were coming from out of town so there was a lot of coordinating to be done. The director of sales, Katie Genrich, went to any lengths to assure that we had enough rooms and also accommodated last minute changes without any extra charges. She also set up an after party in the Badgerland Bar and Grill for our guests after the wedding.
When we arrived on Wednesday the staff was beyond accommodating. The helped us with our bags and of course we were greeted with their signature cookies upon check-in which were delicious! Also, waiting in my fiance and my room was a 6 pack of Wisconsin's finest and a note saying anything we needed we just had to ask. Throughout the weekend that could not have been more true. On Friday, when some of the wedding plans were changed last minute, the staff helped open and setup up tables for the groom's party to get ready in in one of their conference rooms. When we had family that had to cancel last minute because of a family emergency, the canceled their rooms without charge. 
Beyond the big things, their service in general was outstanding. Prompt delivery with luggage trolleys, delicious and timely room service, and extra cookies when we would come in late at night from the bars all made the experience of staying at the Double Tree above and beyond that of really any hotel I have stayed at before.

234,5,2,"Ironically enough, just a week after my stay at the Madison Doubletree, I dressed up as Cookie Monster for Halloween. Curious coincidence? Or possibly due to the fact that ever since coming here, I've had cookies on the brain?

There are a lot of great things about staying at this hotel. A whole bunch of things, which I'll delve into later. But, first and foremost, the best and most unique aspect of this hotel are the mind-blowing amazing chocolatey chocolate chip cookies they give you upon checking in! You have not had a chocolate chip cookie in life until you've had these; they're soft, chewy, warm, and loaded up with a ton of chunky chocolate chips. Bring milk, because you're definitely gonna want some. I was lucky enough to have one of these bad boys every day because they were provided after lunch at the training I was attending in one of their meeting rooms, but I have heard if you can snag a few extra from the front desk if you ask nicely.

All cookies aside, there are a TON of great things to say about this hotel:

-They have a free shuttle service that runs from 7am - 10pm that will take you anywhere you need to go within a 2 mile radius of the hotel. We got lucky the few times we wanted to use it and they were able to accommodate us right away, but definitely try to plan ahead with the front desk ahead of time. This helped us save a ton of money on cab fare!
-The rooms here are great! My one complaint is that there wasn't an available outlet for me to charge my phone near my bed (talk about first world problems), but aside from that I was really impressed with everything. I noticed that others weren't very fond of the unique shower door, but I'm actually a huge fan of this--#fancy! I could seriously get lost in the king bed, and hellooo, there are even microwaves in the room! So perfs for a leftover hoarder like me.
-While I never used it, free parking is always welcomed. Who doesn't like free?
-The location is perfectly walkable distance from the University, State Street and the Capital. Everywhere we wanted to go was less than a 10 minute walk away.
-Decent gym considering the size of the hotel, not to mention the equipment is brand new and sparkling clean! And in addition to the pool there's also a heated pool and a hot tub! 
-Remarkable customer service; it comes down to all the small things, a smile from the front desk attendants, room service organizing my toiletries on the bathroom counter, a newspaper slipped underneath my door every day. All these small details really made me feel like a valued guest, even though the rate they charge is bargain worthy.

bc of canceled flight due to weather, my stay was shortened from 2 nights to 1; i'm glad the hotel agreed to not charge the agent first night's ""no-show"" (well i called my ""agent"" first thing from the departing airport), so i won't get passed on with the penalty. and they still have my booking intact coz you know how some things could get messed up in that kind of situation.

i was quickly checked in and given a room on the ground floor with two full-size beds.  the room is very sizable (fits two beds comfortably, plus a table and a sofa chair), clean, and well-kept.  bed was comfy and free of itch/bugs.  i would say the pillows were comfy too, but i can't recall exactly.  bathroom was a good size, well-equipped and clean.  there even was a complimentary ""sleep cd"" for your perusal!  

everything else was in good condition except the slide window didn't seem to lock properly.  wouldn't be as concerned if i wasn't traveling alone and/or wasn't put on the 1st floor facing the side parking area.  called for maintenance to take a look as i went out, but came back to find that they thought they ""fixed"" it but really didn't.  i was getting a bit upset and thought to bother them again, but it turned out it was just the way the knob/ledge turns that makes it work.  well if that's the case i would've appreciated if they had helped me CLOSE the window after they came to look at it instead of leaving it ajar and unlocked.  guess i have luck (or their security) to thank for not losing anything from the room.

other than that i had no other complaints w/the staff.  since it was such a short stay i didn't get to use any other hotel facilities.  there is a good sized indoor pool right opposite the lobby and a tiny arcade room by the turn of corner.  the pool is ""covered"" by glass windows which give you all the natural lights you want, if a bit transparent and ""out-of-place"" to be right in the ground floor by the front door.  if i were in it i might get self-conscious as ANYONE passing by the lobby (or maybe even those standing outside by the door!?) could see me lounging around in my bathing suit.  other than that, the pool area itself looked pretty nice.

on the opposite side of the road where the hotel is located, there is sizable strip mall-like kind of complex that houses many shops, fast-food/chinese take-out places, and restaurants (judging from the store fronts & signs).  mcdonald's is literally right across the side street; i walked out through the aforementioned parking lot to get breakfast the next day, in sweats and flip flop!  only down side is, cab ride into downtown (capitol/UW) is about $20 one way w/o traffic, so if you're intending to do business in town you may as well stay closer to where everything else is.

would say this place has good value for money if you're looking for a hotel with facilities and a clean, sizable, and quiet room for your stay.  plus free shuttle to/from airport.",Crowne Plaza Hotel - Madison,4402 E Washington Ave,53704,2.5,"{'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Corkage': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'quiet'"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_free'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'""}","Hotels & Travel, Restaurants, Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Venues & Event Spaces"

The room was nice, a good size, and clean. The bathroom was a great size, and was big enough for my mom and me to share (though it may have looked like a war-zone when we were finished getting ready!)

There wasn't any continental breakfast, which my mom was upset about, but I didn't mind. We were running late the morning of the graduation after being out drinking in the streets of Madison a little late the night before, and after running downstairs to their restaurant to get something to go, they let me grab some stuff from the buffet for free! I must have looked frazzled enough they thought I was a graduate, about to be late for my commencement? Either way, it was very kind and appreciated.

The hotel could have been walking distance from some bars, but it was quite cold when we there, so we took short cab rides to/from the bars.

277,4,11,"I've stayed at nearly every hotel in Madison in this price range. There's not a lot of variation in the quality of the hotel or the rooms themselves. The devil, as they say, is in the details.

Pros:

*free Wi-Fi

*free parking

*comfortable bed

*warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in

*convenient location

*indoor pool and whirlpool

*on-site restaurant 

*friendly staff

*free local shuttle

Cons:

*weird shower. Clearly they're going for a ""European"" feel as there was only half a glass door on the stall so I experienced an unpleasant draft on my backside during the shower

*it's a little dated. This used to be a Howard Johnson, and it still has a bit of a ""low budget"" feel

*slow elevators, and too few

As with any hotel in any city, price will vary during season. We happened to be in Madison during move-in weekend for incoming freshman at UW, so the price was likely higher than normal, but still was not terribly expensive.

Although the location was great, it was also across the street from a house that some undergrads were moving into and hosting a kegger, so it was a bit loud at times, but thankfully it ended early. Come to think of it, the whole neighborhood is full of undergrad housing, so be forewarned.

2 adults, 2 kids on a mini-vacation
I'm a Hilton Honors member.

+ Super clean hotel! (The area by the air conditioner were well-dusted. Table tops, inside of cabinets, lampshades were all very well dusted. I usually inspect these places in hotel rooms because they are most missed when cleaning.)

+ Friendly staff. Everyone we met (front desk, maintenance crew, restaurant staff) were all super friendly. 

+ Super clean hotel

+ Five minutes upon checking in, I get a text from the manager asking how our room was and if I needed anything? GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!

+Super clean hotel

+ Great amenities:
a) Free parking 
b) Fridge and microwave in room
c) Free Wifi for HH members (not sure for non-members)
d) Breakfast available for HH members ($14.99 for non-members, I believe...Don't quote me on that)
e) Restaurant attached to the hotel
f) Room service until 11PM
g) Indoor pool (Big hit with the kids!)
h) Spa/sauna (Super relaxing! My husband wanted to stay longer just for the sauna. He said his neck muscles never felt that relaxed.)
i) Comfortable beds
h) TV/Cable
j) Desk for those who like to combine work and vacation

+ Did I say: Super clean hotel?

+ Meeting rooms and event spaces available

+ Free warm cookies upon check in! The kids thought that was the coolest thing in the world! Cookies + pool = kids were happy...Ok, fine...Husband and I were happy, too. Who does not like cookies, right?

All good, right? No. I walked in my room and the ac unit was off completely. I didn't know at the time, but that should've been a warning. Because it didn't work. My room was a fricking sauna, and no matter how low I turned the temperature it just blew hot air. After a few hours of fighting with the thermostat I called the front desk. The maintenance guy walked in, propped the door open, and told me it's so hot he would've called sooner. He fiddled with something and got the cool air blowing again. Hallelujah. 

The room itself was dirty, dated, and falling apart. Curtain was torn, bathtub stopper completely warped, bathroom counter literally pulling away from the wall, on and on. In critical need of updates and maintenance. With the torn curtain and large under-door gap, the room was well-lit all through the night. This is not a good thing. But whatever, I'm only here a week so as long as the ac was working I can deal. I pulled the curtain closed as much as possible and stuffed a towel at the bottom of the door. 

Then I woke up this morning sweating because my ac was again blowing hot air. It's 35 outside, I have the ac set on 60 (lowest setting), and it's so hot I'm just sitting there sweating. So I decided if it was still messed up when I got off work I'd ask to switch rooms. 

Arrived at the hotel after work and tried to go in the side entrance I'd been using, but my key wasn't working. Cool it's 30 degrees and now I have to walk around the entire building. Go in and tell the front desk my key isn't working, get a new key and go to the room. You guessed it, sweltering. Went back down to the front desk, told them I needed to switch rooms. 

Got to the new room and it's badly in need of updates as well. The first room was missing toiletries, this one has no trash can. 

I also had the do not disturb sign on my door and when I got back to the hotel my room had been cleaned. I don't like people touching my stuff at all, which is why I use the sign. All of my things were moved. All of them. I understand hotels now do wellness checks and like to view the room periodically. That's fine. But I didn't want housekeeping.

By the time I went through all of that the food I had gotten right before was cold and I was pissed. I stopped staying at Holiday Inns last year because the quality just wasn't there. Now I know it's the whole IHG family. I won't be making this mistake again. 

A few other things:
Why the hell is the pool in the lobby? I hope you aren't self-conscious if you want to swim, because the pool is in full view of anyone in the lobby AND outside. 

Why doesn't IHG have digital keys yet? Other chains I never even visit the front desk, it's all done on their apps. But I dealt with the front desk staff here enough to make up for not seeing them during visits at other chains. 

Put a fridge in the rooms. People are staying here for days at a time. I don't want to eat out for every meal. I don't want to waste food I'd still eat but don't want at the time. 

Odari at the front desk was the ONLY saving grace for this hell hole. He was efficient, helped take care of the numerous problems, and was friendly throughout, even when I was obviously getting peeved. He deserves better.

Let's start with the pros:

1. On site restaurants, arriving close to 9 pm we predicted our future consisted of ordering take out pizza or Chinese food, but to our surprise they had a grill with a full bar and decent food menu.

2. Starbucks coffee on site, although not open throughout the day.

3. Buffer continental breakfast for 14$ every morning.

Cons:
1. Old carpets, elevators, bathroom wallpaper, beds, headrests, furniture etc etc etc, the hotel is in need for a serious upgrade.

2. Overpriced pantry, like seriously, 6$ for a bottle of water and 2.5$ for a 3 musketeers bar ?!!!!!

3. Our tap in the sink for some reason was putting out black water when we opened it in the morning, old plumbing ?!

311,3,0,"Champagne and campaign (cf. Jalen Rose), flash and cash, swank and style! Doubletree is an example in business school case studies of brand metonymy: an immediate set of emotional reactions released when one hears a word. But I didn't get that from this Doubletree by Hilton Hotel Madison (not sure if a chain of mergers and acquisitions involving Hilton diluted reality of brand vs. image of brand.)

LOOK, it's not a bad hotel by any means. The sheets got cleaned, and the service staff was super nice. But the physical plant is more like a building with a Doubletree sticker than the ostentatiousness one expects from Doubletree. It looked more like a Best Western conversion. Here are just a few more things where it fell short of the vaunted doubletree standard. Also, disclaimer: I'm not some hotel snob. I'm a cheap function over form-type guy. But when I enter a Doubletree vs. a Courtyard by Marriot, I expect some key differences. Here are some examples where expectations fell short.

Number one: it was raining on the day I arrived, and I had a place to go. You'd expect a 4-star place to have free umbrellas, but nope, I was directed to the gift shop and asked to pay $7. What?!

Number two: the toothbrush was one of those atrocious freebies where the plastic bristles come off with each thrust and get stuck between your teeth. It was a hazard to my gums, and I really had to work to get things clean.

Number three: this is a generalizable complaint. What's with hotels handing out horrible two-blade and one-blade razors that guarantee at least 1-2 bloody cuts a day? I expect DOUBLETREE to at least go with the three-blade, but nope. I cut myself each day, and one really bad cut at the edge of my mouth made it look like I got into a streetfight. ""Hey, yo, no, I didn't get into a streetfight. I just stayed at the Doubletree and used the cheap 2-blade razor."" The only thing I can say is at least they didn't give the yellow 1-blade Bic razor, which seems designed to leave permanent bloody scars all over one's face. I can't believe hotels still give those away with a straight face. Ever been scammed by a salesperson (at, say, a used car dealership)? I feel this is the same sort of micro-sociological interaction. Keeping that smiley face while knowingly giving people a dermatologically hazardous product!

There are some pluses: they gave me a free banana and extra cookies when I wanted them, and the staff is extremely friendly.

I asked him to call down and get a new one but he didn't want to do it. I took a picture of the pillow case and told the front desk person about it at the time of checkout. She said thanks for letting her know and she would have someone take care of it.
Now we're back a month later and we get the same room. My husband was using my pillow from the bed so I decided to go in the closet and get the extra pillow. I was okay with the pillow in the bag until I flipped the pillow over. IT WAS THE SAME PILLOW CASE FROM A MONTH AGO! If you're actually washing the bedding there is no way we should have the exact same bedding in the same room. I am so grossed out that it makes me uncomfortable just sleeping in the bed. Did they change the sheets from the last person who stayed in the room this morning? It's time to start staying at the hotels in downtown Madison.

The rooms really need to be upgraded or remodeled it's very outdated. The pull out bed was an old dirty mattress, kids complained their was a bar sticking out. The pool was so cold my kids couldn't even stand it and they were determined to swim. I can understand if the pool was cold it's all windows surrounding it and it has been very cold but it was dirty too. There was a film on the top of the water and there was visible dirt in the bottom of the pool in several spots-not the ground was stained but it needed to be vacuumed out.

The maintenance man came who was extremely nice and helpful. He checked out room and it was 56 degrees. He brought a space heater and fixed the heat.

At check in the attendant could not find our reservation as it was entered with the wrong check in date in the hotel's computer system. This problem haunted us our entire stay. We were expressed checked out on Monday even though we were scheduled to leave on Tuesday. Then on Tuesday the new bill showed a no show charge for that wrong check in date.

The 2nd morning we could not make coffee in the room as the coffee maker was missing the carafe, and the swing arm that holds the carafe.

Our own utensil (spoon) was missing and never returned. 

The lobby was always very cold and when I noted that to the front desk person,she showed me the space heater she brought in for her use. (It's 80 degrees outside.)

Sunday night at 9 P.M. our party of four ordered dinner of sandwiches and salads at Growlers Restaurant off the main lobby. Our order took about 40 minutes even though most of the other patrons were only drinking.

We used the workout room. The bicycle was old and in need of repair. The facility is limited.

A lamp in the room was missing a light bulb the entire stay.

The tub for the shower is very slippery.

The elevators to the rooms arrived quickly. Checkin was so friendly. She was so pleasant and sweet. Even the two employees in the elevator handling room service asked me how I was doing and pushed the button for my floor. The room was clean and spacious. They refrigerated my two bottles of water so they were cold when I arrived and had a snack waiting for me in the room.

1 star for a secure, quiet floor- I love these, and at no extra cost, even better.
1 star for great front desk staff.
1 star for restaurants surrounding it- right across the street from a mall and your choice of multiple places to eat.

340,4,0,"First thing to know is the hotel is in a neighborhood near the college campus. It's in walking distance to a street with a lot of restaurants and such. I assume it's also the college kids night time hangout spot. So it's an interesting spot for a Doubletree. It takes a little while to get to a major road so access is something to consider. Also, due to the young residents around the hotel the nights I spent there were  not overly quiet.
I pulled up and walked in the  lobby to check in. First thing I noticed was the lobby smelled like an old bar that allowed smoking in the past but never really got the old smoke smell out. My guess is they have people smoke outside and the wind carries it inside. 
The staff were very pleasant and helpful. More so than I am used to so this was a big plus.
The hotel feels like an older building that Hilton may have taken over at some point. Just the layout was very closed and not open at all. The parking is complimentary but you need your key to enter. 
They upgraded me to a suite so my comfort was that much better in such a large room. They also gave me voucher for three free items in their hotel pantry and a free beverage in the restaurant. Not typical and a good surprise.
The restaurant/bar is a branded place I will give a separate review on as it's attached to this review I would say it was generally a good place though I had some up/down service there.

346,1,0,"Complicated scenario, but I feel like I should definitely write this.  I am writing this review in November of 2015.  Make absolutely certain that you call and make sure that the construction is over before you reserve.  If they tell you it's not a big deal, don't listen.  Everyone--regardless of floor or room--was miserable.  I have never in my life had a problem with construction--I lived in Manhattan for years and noise doesn't tend to touch me.  It felt like the ceiling was falling in.  It was actually scary, not just annoying.  STAY AWAY until the construction is complete.

That said, everyone working there is doing everything they can to make up for it.  They can't really do anything about the construction obviously, but they are surely well aware of how insane it is and so are as accommodating as they can be (shuttle wasn't running so they actually paid for my cab, forgot toothpaste and the guy actually sprinted to get it to me so that I barely sat back down after making the call to the front desk, etc).

358,5,1,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how great this place was! 

Booked a room very last minute and was very happy to see they had availability. Upgraded to one of the smaller suites that had a great wall of windows to gaze out. 

The room itself was very clean, neatly appointed, and modern. Everything we needed was there. The bathroom was fresh and modern as well. The only thing I didn't care for was the sliding barn-style door that was in place for the bathroom. I don't not like this type of door typically, but when it was closed completely, there was still a small gap, making it feel less private. If the door had been just slightly wider, or the track just a tad longer, the issue would be fixed. Very minor issue, though. 

We ordered room service. The kitchen staff allowed us to order off-menu which will automatically give you an A in my book. The food arrived at our door in record time! Usually room service in other hotels has been slow, sloow, sloooow. Not here! And it was piping hot and delicious!

Staff was not always very courteous or professional, but the two mornings I requested early access to the fitness center they accommodated my request. A couple of recommendations for the hotel management: 1) Open the fitness center before 6 am. Most people will have meetings or other obligations they need to attend to and if they can't get into the fitness center earlier they will be unable to use it. 2) Some additional training is needed for the staff. Most people who are traveling and away from home appreciate being made to feel welcome and treated with curtesy. I found this to be lacking in every experience with the front desk staff. They were rushed and dismissive each time (all different staff members). 3) Provide at least a couple of bottles of water for guests in the rooms. Madison water tastes horrible.

360,3,0,"My significant other treated me to a weekend in a hotel after I took the LSAT. I adore him because he took me to this particular hotel.

It wasn't his first choice, but it was subsequently Homecoming weekend and everything else was filled up. Regardless, it wasn't like we were disappointed and distressed over having to come here.

The rooms were clean, spacious, free WiFi, and had a decent TV with a view. There was nothing to complain about on that front! Even later when we went down to the hotel bar, we both had found something good--a whiskey for him, and some dessert for me. (It was a chocolate brownie. It was amazing.)

Subsequently, that was also where two of my three complaints came about:

1. The bartender was a little tipsy and I'd ordered an amaretto sour and 2. the entire thing was practically amaretto. And not good amaretto either. The cheap stuff, so it was basically like drinking almond cough syrup--but without the fun, NyQuil effects. Ugh, you're killing me here, Best Western.

Don't act like you've never had a bad amaretto sour before--you know exactly what I'm talking about.

The third complaint was in the morning. It was partially our fault for not leaving a sign on the door, but as we were sleeping, a housekeeper came in at about 7:45am and we hadn't checked out yet (obviously.) We were both a little irritated by that, given that we were both also not entirely appropriately dressed enough to handle strangers in our room at that time of the morning.

That said, the place isn't bad. I'd probably come back again, but those little kinks are worth mentioning if alcohol and being found randomly by a housekeeper at 7:45am might be deal breakers for you. Or you could just be smart and put the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign up.",Best Western Premier Park Hotel,22 S Carroll St,53703,3.5,"{'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3'}","Real Estate, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Home Services, Commercial Real Estate, Event Planning & Services"

The room was furnished nicely and was spacious.  The bathroom had a jetted tub and a shower with a nice head on it.  I only have two complaints.  First, the pillows were too small.  I think they are going for a look using square decorative sized pillows.  They are the size of small decorative couch pillows, which are very uncomfortable to sleep on.  To top it off they only have standard sized pillow cases, so they fold the excess fabric into the case in such a way that there are creases you can feel as you lay on them.  I probably could have called down to the front desk and gotten some standard ones, but I didn't.  My only other complaint is that the bathroom fan was not functional, and since there was no other means of ventilation in there the mirror fogged for a long time and it made it more difficult to get ready.  Otherwise the service was great, the pool area and workout facility was really cool, and the location was unbeatable.

366,1,2,"The hotel itself is lovely, with a room view of the Capitol across the street, and from the 7th floor. However, the staffing has some MAJOR issues.
Having booked with AAA rewards, our room rate was reduced- if we had payed full price, there would have been serious complaints lodged at a corporate level.
Arrival and check in went well.
Lacking a hot tub was inconvenient- however the whirlpool jet bathtub was a nice addition to the room.
All night there was the sound of running water consistently.
The next morning, check out was at noon.
While still in bed at 10 am, a maid ENTERED OUR ROOM. If there was a knock,it was not heard- the room has a seating/desk area that can be closed off from the bedroom and bathroom area. The maid apologized and left, however it is unacceptable that a room that was being checked out of in two hours was entered by morning routine housekeeping...period.
Using their telephone checkout system, we left our room and did not need to stop at the front desk to check out traditionally. Greeted by a line of five groups of guests, waiting (and filling the lobby completely- I might add). One valet was working, and everyone was stuck unable to leave, smashed together in a tiny lobby, with luggage laying everywhere.
After FINALLY getting our vehicle and hitting the road, I realized I left a 19.5 fl. oz. size bottle of expensive shampoo (aprox. half full) in the shower of the room we had just checked out of.
At 8pm that evening I called the hotel- to ask if the bottle had been turned in. And a muffled man answered the phone mumbling so badly I didn't understand if I had called the right number. His response to my explanation was that it was thrown away- let me transfer you to housekeeping and you can leave them a voicemail.
I told him that was unacceptable, and that I have a personal item that got left behind and that I was just told it's getting thrown away.
After going 'round a few more times, I was asked to hold so he could check and ""see if a manager is just sitting around to take my call.""
I spoke with a manager named Sandy, who was not an observant listener in problem solving. While explaining to her the situation I said I had been told it got thrown away- and I asked her if they just throw things away how do they know that items aren't actually just growing legs and walking away- to which she cut me off and began storming about me accusing her staff members of stealing- etc. etc. etc.
After a few minutes of going off I asked if she was done interrupting me yet- and then explained to her how I was told by the front desk that my item had just been thrown away- and that to a guest who loses something of value- it's slightly suspicious, and does not feel good as a customer who is staying in a NICE hotel in a larger city.
She huffed with me about getting contact information- and was very bothered by the fact that I didn't have a contact number readily available for her.
I received an apology about the man who answered the phone- for the way he handled the situation. But she never once offered any sort of condolence.
I was called back about ten minutes later- and informed that the housekeeping had logged my item and that it was safe.
She asked if I was local and could pick the item up or if I needed it shipped- and after my response of local, she hung up immediately.

I loved that she helped guide us through every detail, setting up a timeline and coordinating everything the day of the wedding so that we didn't have to worry about a thing. She took my husband and I from a chaotic mess of ideas floating around and somehow helped us create a wedding reception that exceeded our expectations. 

I loved that the staff at the Inn on the Park was flexible with our Friday night wedding, letting us come in the night before to decorate. The reception itself was beautiful and the food was great! We had a band instead of a DJ and the venue was very flexible with it, letting the band set up early in the day. We also had a photobooth and that was no problem at all. We got married in the Capitol and I love that the Inn on the Park was so close to our ceremony location - no worries about transportation or our guests unable to find the location or our guests driving anywhere after the reception. 

And I have nothing but compliments about the hotel as well. Our room was gorgeous and we loved waking up in the morning on the Capitol square - and the farmer's market! I would recommend the Inn on the Park to anyone planning a wedding.

The actual room was clean, upscale, and the bed was comfy! It was a pretty standard room for this kind of place, but it did the trick and I was the only one in there! 

The only downside was that the restaurant was only ok vs the hyped up website attached to it. The website made it look like it was a hip hangout spot. Instead, it was just a standard bar and breakfast place. It was still good, but not great! Also, they charge guests $15 per night to valet a car. While it wasn't a huge deal and the valets were all very nice and professional, I thought it was a bit steep compared to the free parking at some of the other hotels!

I guess, I should preface what brought me to staying at this hotel; I recently got married and needed a block of rooms reserved. We had 10 reserved in our block. I was told that if my block started to get full, I could call and more rooms would be available as I knew I was going to need more than 10. I called WELL AHEAD of when our block of rooms would no longer be available for booking as a family member called me to tell me all rooms were taken (a month ahead of the cut-off time for our reserved block). I called best western and they told me the entire hotel was booked for that day. No one called to tell me my block was full, like I was told they would. 
So great. Now I have family from across the country needs somewhere to stay. And family from other parts of this state. I had to book a second block of rooms at a different hotel.
Not ideal. Not at all. 

The thing that really upset me, is that my uncle was able to book his room a week out of my wedding date-he booked through a travel website (note sure which) but when he called the hotel to ask a question in regards to his reservation, he asked about additional rooms they said they had other rooms available at that time.

Are you kidding me.

386,4,0,"You can't beat the location, and the staff were excellent. We had trouble with the hair dryer in our room, and a member of the housekeeping staff was there within 4 minutes of our calling the front desk. The issue was resolved quickly and pleasantly. Reservations at a local restaurant were also made by the front desk staff in a speedy manner. They also allowed me to tour a few different types of rooms for our next stay. 

Parts of the decor are a little dated, especially in the common areas. I will say, though, that this is the impression you get right when you enter the lobby because of the gold gates all along the side of the bar/restaurant in the lobby. It looks very 80's fabulous. However, there is a story behind the gold, and it's pretty cool - check it out when you are near the restaurant. The decor in the room was okay, and the bathroom had clearly been updated recently. The bathroom was tiny, but it was laid out very intelligently, so it wasn't problematic. 

We had a standard room with 2 queen beds and a refrigerator, which was fine for our family of 3. The TV was not fancy, but why are you watching television here? Go out and do something fun! I toured an oversized double queen room, and there wasn't much of a difference - the room was a little wider, and the sleeping area was a little longer, but it didn't add much usable space. It did have a desk, but it was crammed in there. If you needed to use a port-a-crib, the extra bit of room in this upgrade might be worth it, but otherwise - not so much. 

Valet parking is free, which is lovely. The bar didn't have a very wide selection, but the bartender provided generous pours and service that was attentive without being obnoxious.

Check-in was quick and easy and the front desk friendly.

The room was clean but quite enormous and the TV was way too small the size - we didn't spend much time in there so it wasn't an issue.  The beds were a bit soft, with these weird sort of half pillows but once I got situated, I think I got a good night's sleep.  We never heard any activity in the hall and it was generally really quiet even with what we know to have been a lot of people in the hotel this past weekend.  The pool was decent - the area is comfortable and they do have towels that you can use so you don't have to bring them from your room.  If you have little kids, keep in mind that the pool goes from 4 to 6 feet - nothing shallower than that - and there is no lifeguard on duty.

392,1,5,"We stayed here for the recent Ironman WI for its close proximity to the event.  The hotel itself was beautiful.  Nice, recently updated rooms.  The restaurant was still closed, so they did offer free breakfast daily. 
The front desk staff was awful.  Did not tell us of this free breakfast until asking about it as I had seen it on another review site.  Also asking for local info from the staff was met with blank stares and the comment of ""walk out the door and you'll find 60 around here"" when asking req's for a local restaurant.  Asking which way to go was again given ""any direction"". Also asking for a local grocery store we were told ..""umm.. Walgreens?""  (We told them we had a car and we're will to drive) 

But, the number 1 most disturbing thing was being woken up Friday night at 2:35am to an intruder standing over our bed in our room.  This person had to come thru the living room and into the bedroom to get to the bed and did so without turning on a light.   My husband jumped up yelling at the guy, and I started screaming.  We got him into the hallway and I called the front desk frantic about this intruder.  They did come up and my husband and the front desk staff escorted him downstairs.  We then asked how he got in and he did NOT have a room key.  Come to find out, our room door did not latch even with the bolt turned.  You had to push the door hard to get it to latch.  We did not know this until that night.  The intruder had a text from friends to come to that room number.  Supposedly he was drunk and didn't know any better he was in the wrong hotel.  What are he odds THAT particular room didn't latch?!? 

The staff called the police and we were later told they took him to jail.  Days Later yet, the hotel manager said the guy got away and the police couldn't locate him.  They lied to us until we asked for a police report number.  

The hotel did come up to fix our door upon our request. There was fresh wood in the door jam.  Nothing was said to us on the condition of the door, if there was an object in it preventing it from latching.  

We did not get any apology from the staff or manager except a comment that ""it was a drunk guy and he didn't mean any malice"".   I also asked about hotel security in the middle of the night for non guests to enter to which I was told in 3 more days they will have a key card entry at the main doors at night.  

When checking out, we were shocked to see not a single night was comped.  We asked for the manager to call us and have repeatedly called and they will not return our calls.   I don't expect the entire stay comped, but at least for the night(s) we had a faulty door and now I will forever be wary of an intruder over my bed.  This could have ended very differently than it did.  On both our part or the intruders part.  

Extremely upset over he nonchalant way this hotel handled this situation.

405,2,4,"I'm updating my previous review after staying at the hotel this past weekend for the 2nd time. After this 2nd stay I have a different opinion on this hotel. 

Here are the Pros: The hotel has a great location, a pool, mini fridge in room,free wifi, free public printer/computer and free parking. The room service breakfast was nothing to write home about, but it was brought up fast and the girl who delivered it was polite. The hotel overall is very clean which is a big plus!

And now here are my Cons:
-The hotel and the rooms are outdated for my taste, I guess their going for a colonial look to match the capitol, but some of the furniture has seen better days. 

-Had to take two separate elevators to any room above 7th floor

-The front desk staff on a Saturday night could not be bothered to give me a number for a cab company, he told me to just stand outside in the cold. If the square wasn't blocked off for a marathon maybe I would have found one, ended up getting an Uber instead.

-And now to my real beef of the weekend and why I most likely will bring my business elsewhere: The same front desk clerk was unenthusiastic when I asked him to look up the parking ticket I had accidentally left in the room. Eventually after a few eye rolls he looked into it. I thought this was nonsense because they mention to you as you check in that if you forget your ticket they can look it up for you! The night bellhop was equally unhelpful. I fully understand that a lost ticket is probably annoying, but I was literally the only guest around so these guys were not busy at all, they were just being straight rude and lazy. I tried to explain my key chains to the bellhop who seriously couldn't even be bothered to look. He told me to look for it, so I went into his station and looked at a huge wall of keys with no help from him. I was being extremely polite and tried to make small talk multiple times and he showed zero interest. Then because it is valet I had to be walked up to my car by the same rude guy just to get my coat.

422,2,8,"I'm sorry to say this, but the Magnuson Grand Hotel is anything but grand. More like a grand disappointment. I booked this hotel blindly on Expedia.com at an extremely low rate after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. I noticed that it had 4.0 stars at the time. What a farce.

While the friendly staff & hot tub area were probably the highlights of my visit, things seemed to go downhill from here. Upon first impression, the hotel has a weird odor to it, as if someone is leaving a pot full of Chinese food & green fart gas within every hallway of the hotel. The parking lot is not well-lit and quite dark, which is strange, considering that the Harley-Davidson dealership next door is well-lit and can be seen for miles. Not only that, but there are some shady characters within the parking lot. Have you ever had people panhandle for money outside of a hotel? I did on this visit. Not just that, but I thought that it was a bit weird seeing cars full of Cheech & Chong-like marijuana smoke within the parking lot, in addition to a few folks sleeping within their cars. 

The room? C'mon now. Old, old, OLD furniture with paper-thin walls to the point where you can hear everyone's conversations and subtle movements within the bathroom & bed. The one benefit of the room was that the internet access was actually pretty good. There is an internet tool on the desk that you have to plug in a cord into a laptop, yet the downside to this is that the same cord will limit tablet users. What a pain.

Breakfast here was so-so. Not spectacular, as some would allude to. Old fruit, cereal, eggs & sausage with a couple of bagel & toast options. That's about it. 

If I had to, I would call this the Magnuson Grand Motel, not Hotel. The old saying of getting what you pay for is absolutely true.

432,1,0,"Unfortunately, our experience using the Magnuson Grand for our wedding block was just a mess in every sense of the word. We had chosen them because they were close to our venue and provided a shuttle for free to our guests - in hindsight, we would rather have paid an extra expense to hire a professional shuttle service and found a hotel that might have been more enjoyable. 

I had set up my block months in advance and had a hard time getting answers to the questions I would send in the months leading up to the wedding - turns out that's because the staff turnover was extremely high and a handful of different people had been tasked with managing wedding blocks throughout the time period. Unanswered emails and phone calls, promises to get in touch with me that never came through, getting different answers from different people, etc. I will say that the woman who received the mess that others had left her, Stephanie, was very nice when I went in to meet with her a couple weeks before the wedding and did her best to problem solve many of the issues that had come up with our wedding block due to others' negligence. She was surprised when we opened my file that no one had ever asked me to sign a contract or pay a deposit, something that apparently should have been done months earlier, or that no one had contacted me to set up the shuttle schedule yet. There were copies of my unanswered emails in the file, as well. 

Things only got worse as the wedding approached. Guests had a very hard time booking their rooms within the hotel block and found the staff unhelpful when dealing with them over the phone. Once everyone arrived, we were greeted with more disarray and puzzling actions by the hotel. Instead of our guests being roomed near each other (and us!), we were all split amongst three different floors. One of our guests was comp'ed his room because he found beer bottles in the first one they gave him, and dirty towels in the second. Nearly all of our guests had to go back to the front desk and get new keys after going to their rooms because they had changed the locks on the doors. The next morning, breakfast was pretty disappointing, but predictable given our other experience. Aside from a small offering of cereal or toast/bagels, the hot dishes were inedible. The eggs were so unappealing that I literally spit out the bite in my mouth rather than swallow it. The staff then proceeded to begin putting breakfast away at 9:15, when it was supposed to be available until 10:00.

He then informed me that the maintenance person had gone for the day and recommended to try inserting the plug again. Of course it did not work, since the whole point of the stay was to enjoy the jacuzzi we decided to make a homeshift plug of our own. It did work and we had a very relaxing soak. In the morning we found that the coffee maker was broken. And to add insult to injury, the room included a teacup set but no tea.

The most disturbing is first.  One of the elevators had a broken button for the first floor.   It was operable, so we were using it.  We thought the staff would've known as it looked as it was broken for a while.  My husband called for the elevator one morning and when the door opened there was a scared woman who didn't speak much English was pushing the ""1"" by the now completely gone button.  They went up one floor and got in the other elevator.  He then told the desk worker (I had to find her first).  We found signs for a broken elevator hanging from ""above"" the broken elevator door.  When we got back it was fixed, my point is they should've fixed when the problem first came up. 
While we had the Do Not Disturb on our door, I saw no evidence of the hallway floor being vacuumed during our four nights there, even after the weekend.  When we left on Tuesday, the same garbage was in the same place as it was when we arrived on Friday.

Here's what we noticed while we were there:
   1. The hotel looks nice outside and inside however I think they may be in the middle of doing some renovations because there were a couple things my husband and I noticed during our stay but it wasn't anything that made our stay any less pleasant. 
   2. There was a shelf / banister in our room that wasn't sealed down properly and when my husband set something on the end of it, the board came loose (see picture).
   3. The water fountain / bubbler in the pool area definitely needs to be replaced (see picture).
   4. The pool is not a big as we thought it would be but it was a decent size if you don't plan on doing laps. (see picture)

We found it a bit funny (as in we thought it was rediculous) that they had a sign in the rooms saying that if you took any items (such as alarm clock, towels, ironing board, etc) instead of getting them from housekeeping that you agree to pay X amount for them - basically saying if you steal any of the following items you would be charged X amount for each item

The only real negative is that when we tried calling the front desk from our room (about 3 different times) the line was busy and the few time we needed to get more towels or ask a question at the front desk, the attendant wasn't there and we ended up having to wait or come back.

We also stayed Friday night before the wedding with the wedding party. This hotel was the most stressful part of my whole wedding. It started the week before the wedding when they lost all the agreements that we had made a year before regarding comped rooms, shuttle, reservations, and blocked rooms. They were not accommodating to the number of comp rooms and only comped half of the rooms we had agreed upon. Then they were telling our guests that the reservation was full when we still had 50 more rooms on the block just so they can charge them more money. We had 20 rooms booked on Friday and 55 on Saturday. When we checked in Friday night, they did not comp the rooms they agreed with. Their rooms all smelt like smoke and their owner/front desk person was beyond rude and not accommodating. On Friday, none of the keys were working to get into the rooms, one rooms air conditioning didn't work, and one room smelt so bad that they had to change rooms.

I was allowed to check in early, without calling ahead (I should have), being very friendly about it. Even when they asked to move me due to a heating issues with a conjoined room, they were friendly, nice, and accommodating. I was given a free dinner for my troubles! Thanks!

The catering and banquet services were also good. They were 4 out of 5 in the food area to me, regarding taste. Service was spot on! All my waiters were professional, nice, and great with accommodating vegans. I felt the waitstaff was managed very well and dressed nice. I LOVED the desserts they had. Last nice there was a dessert reception with gluten options! The food in the restaurant was a bit better and high scale. I had the roasted chicken dish, which was juicy and crispy! Again, the waitstaff and hostess were on point.

The rooms were nice. Lots of space in my queen, big tv. However, not too many cable channels, but its OK. Free Wifi that worked everywhere I went in the hotel without fail. It was also high speed despite a large conference was going on.  Our conference usually complains about that to our conference committee, but not this year!

The rooms are fairly nice, nothing too noteworthy. Which is good in my opinion. I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because I'm not super fond of the noise. I get being in a city that there's going to be road noise (sirens going off all night long). But it honestly kept me up. I recommend earplugs for those who are light sleepers. Also, the hallway noise was bit loud as well. I think it was so easy to hear other guests just based on the fact that the door had huge gaps all around it.

This is right in the heart of downtown and close to everything. 
I actually used to live in Madison and sought this hotel out because I had a work party here a couple years ago and knew it was a nice hotel.

-Service was incredible. 
I have stayed in 4&5 star hotels and have not received as friendly of service as I did here. There was some initial confusion with my early check-in but was immediately corrected by the phenomenal lady helping us at the front desk (I believe her name was Amanda). She was very knowledgeable and worked quickly to fix the issue. 

-This hotel cares about their guests.
I filled out the survey they send out after your stay. I was surprised that one of the managers reached out the next day to apologize for the inconveniences we encountered, which weren't even that bad! (I once stayed at a hotel that had issues with their heater BLASTING uncomfortably hot air all night and after multiple calls to the from desk they refused to transfer rooms or offer any compensation).

-Overnight parking was only $10. 
They give you a pass so you can come and go as your please. The parking garage seems pretty safe - I never even thought twice about leaving my car.

-Room was clean and nicely decorated.

451,5,1,"Below is the same review as I left on Tripadvisor, I just loved this hotel so much I felt like posting it to multiple review sites is the least I can do for the unforgettable experience they gave me.



As a ""Millennial"", I can say for certain that I have less brand loyalty than many past generations. Many times, price will be the number one factor for our group, but quality remains important, and finding the perfect balance between to two is how we make most of our purchasing decisions.

After saying all of that, I can say that I will have the utmost brand loyalty and will always be a lifelong customer of the Madison Concourse Hotel & Governors Club. I will never even attempt to search for a different hotel for when I return to Madison. We visited for Valentines Day of 2016, and not only was the rate reasonable for a Governors Club room (Top Floor & View of the lake as requested), I was also surprised by the incredible amount of amenities included with the package. Whether it be 30% off our meal a CIRC, the amazing Governors Club breakfast, drinks & horderves, etc.

As someone who goes all-out to plan great dates, it takes a lot of time, dedication, and work to make the experience go well. The Madison Concourse Hotel & Governors Club made my experience so luxurious and easy that I was able to relax to the full amount.

The staff was incredible. Nice, considerate, helpful, and did it all with a smile. The food at CIRC was the best I have had in months. The room was better than advertised (Comfortable pillows and mattress, extremely clean, lots of room).

Thank you Madison Hotel! You made my experience seamlessly easy, relaxing, and so enjoyable!

455,1,0,"The Concourse was recommended to us from the coordinators of the charity event we attended, in addition, we saw all the wonderful reviews here on Yelp.  Unless you receive a Governor's Club jacuzzi room with no adjoining door to the next hotel room, don't bother.  

We stayed in a Governor's Club room on the 14th floor, which shared a door with the adjoining room. The sound that came through the door was unacceptable -- I mentioned it to the front desk before we went to dinner that night (also mentioning the two large stains on our carpet) and nothing was changed, as there were no additional rooms available in the Governor's Club.  Needless to say, we woke up at 1am when our neighbors came in and again at 7:10am when they were packing up to leave.  This was not ""normal"" hotel noise, this sounded as if our neighbors were IN our room -- we could hear word for word and we could actually see the light shining from under the adjoining door when they were there.  Please note that these neighbors were not being ""loud,"" this was just the most poor insulation we've ever witnessed.  I would expect this kind of thing at a Motel 8.

In addition to the noise, we had two very large stains on our carpet (very tacky for a nicer ""Governor's Club"" Room) and honestly the room was NOTHING special.  We were traveling through NYC a couple weeks ago and the cheesy Hampton Inn in Queens by JFK was the same quality.  A single sink, normal sized room, a king bed...  Does this hotel get such high reviews because it has a large LCD TV??  That's not a draw for me, I can watch TV at home.

Finally, the Governor's Club lounge was so busy the entire time it was open, we could not get in (we went at 4:45pm before our event, and then again at 10pm for dessert).  THE SAME LAME PEOPLE were there from 4:30-10:30pm (what losers! because it's free?!), complete with shorts (in February) and backwards baseball caps.  Not what I was expecting.  And, the dessert was gone at 10pm.

P.S.  The parking garage, which we already paid for (it's not included in the price), was full when we returned at 10pm, so we had to valet our car. We had to get out, go inside the hotel and find someone to park our car -- how nice after a long evening..

Waited for server to seat us but no one was there and it was not busy so we sat ourselves at a table close to our large group that was already there. Sat for 25 minutes without anyone coming to our table. Went to complain and waited 5 minutes for manager to not come so back to the table we went. Manager was polite after he heard an earful so I'll give him that. Hotel manager came and did pay for our dinner because of the combined problems between our check in and dinner. Food was ok for the price but service was very slow. Finally able to check in our original hotel room. Room was ok, blankets were horrible but bed was comfortable. Kids enjoyed the pool and there is a nice bar area in the lobby. Today I checked my bank statement and I was charged $426 for 2 nights (should be $258).

When we checked in, the staff were very helpful. They let us park our cars in the parking structure early. And when we checked out, they didn't take the $20 credit off so they took off the parking structure fee (it's $10/car for overnight parking).

The temperature was something we struggled with for our entire stay -- there was a huge draft right near the window which made the room super cold, but having the heat set at a temperature that adequately combatted that was intolerably loud.  Add in the incessant beeping from the elevators, and it was sensory overload.
The room was nice enough, but the bed and pillows were too squishy for my liking.  The noise and the squish meant I slept poorly two nights in a row and we ended up checking out early because I couldn't bear sleeping there one more night.  

The shower was lovely but it was strange to not have a tub since our preschooler was with us (she adjusted, but younger kids might not).  All of the toiletries were extremely drying as well.  And there's zero privacy if someone needs to use the toilet while you're showering.

491,1,9,"*Management responded to this review, about how great they handled the water main break, kinda sorta ingoring the comments about the fetish convention they hosted. Interesting in what they pick & choose to reply.



Corporate travel assigned this as our hotel.  First trip, upon landing my co-workers messaged us that the hotel had a city water main break out front, causing all water to be turned off at the hotel.  No faucets, no showers, no toilets.  They were booking some at the dinky Holiday Inn next door, and then others at the Hilton Madison.

Upon returning the next week, they upgraded us to club level, and left stale cheese and warm grapes on a plate in the room.  Only one elevator went to the 8th floor club level, so that was aggravating.  The rooms were old, with beat up cabinets and furniture.  The guest room did not have a fresh, updated appearance.  

The bedding was decent with comfortable pillows and a decent mattress.  The bathroom was a walk back in time.  Warning to anyone of average height, they have super low bathroom counter tops.   They're perfect for children, not for adults.

Speaking of adults, the hotel hosted some sort of BDSM/Kink convention, on Friday, January 31, 2014.  While they did a decent job at draping off the first floor entrance to the room they used, the participants still walked the hotel common areas in costume.  You also heard participants speaking of vile, perverse and disgusting acts that would have been better to be spoken of in private, not the hotel common areas.  Anytime you'd ask a hotel front line staff member what was going on they'd tell you they were instructed to lie to any guest that inquired about the sex convention guests and only refer to the meeting as an ""educational seminar.""

I came the weekday night before veteran's day and from a New Yorker's perspective, it was pretty affordable at $149/night, but I don't know how that compares to the cost of living in Madison.

The amenities that came with the room were amazing!
For it's governor's club guests, it gave us a private bar with COMPLIMENTARY drinks all day in one of the top floors that can only be accessed with a governor's club room keycard. They also place out free desserts and hor d'oeuvres at designated times during the day and give out free bottles of water for your daily outdoor excursion. With a private concierge and prime location downtown, both of these made my first experience in Madison a smooth one. 

I also had a beautiful room with a view facing the state capitol and I have to say the biggest perk staying with the governor's club beside its private elevator is that you can request for room service to bring free drinks to your room even after the bar closes at 10pm.

But what really sealed the deal for me in this hotel is that I checked out at 7:30am and in my haste I forgot a bag of Wisconsin local cheese from Fromagination in my room mini-fridge.

The hotel is located right downtown, a short walk around the corner to the Capital Square, and all that it has to offer.  The hotel has an attached garage for $10/night which included in and out privileges. The lobby was beautiful with a big sweeping staircase, a waiting lounge and access to the restaurant. 

We ended up with a corner room, with a partial view of the capitol.  The bed was comfortable and I slept well.  The bathroom was spacious with a beautifully tiled walk-in shower.  The bathroom products were Bath & Body Works. I forgot the scent, but it was nice. 

We booked a room on one of the upper floors that had access to the Governor's Club. This was a great perk! Who can say no to complimentary drinks and food!? Breakfast was served in the morning, appetizers in the afternoon, and cocktails and desserts in the evening.  And the view of the Capital from the Governor's Club can't be beat!

508,2,1,"Some staff were helpful. Some seemed uninterested, the shuttle bus drivers were very nice. The room was clean and the hall decor seemed updated and fine with me. The shuttle service to downtown Madison was a big plus since this hotel is not walkable to much. The rental bikes out front are fabulous when the kiosk is working.

The beds were very comfortable but when the temperature in the room went up a bit and got warmer we could smell urine. We were on the pet floor (without a pet) and so we assume that was what it was. We could never find a luggage cart....

There was a wedding Saturday night, we went and complained about the noise from the partying guests at midnight and it quieted down. We went and spoke to the guests ourselves at 1:30 again when they ""forgot."" We had a fire alarm go off from the drunken wedding guest at 2:45 a.m. There were elderly folks and parents with babies all over the front drive and the manager or staff never came outside and told us a thing. I finally went in to ask and he admitted it was the wedding folks and it was a false alarm. I know it's not their fault, but they could have handled that better. A ""sorry"" at some point about the noise or  alarm would have been nice. Even nicer would have been if the manager had offered us a deal if we came to stay again or free breakfast since we literally got zero sleep Saturday night. 

The wi-fi on the 4th floor was pretty darn mediocre even though the manager said it was fine. I couldn't download my e-mail to my phone!

Here's the thing, I can get a Hampton Inn for about the same price.

Kids running up and down the hall at 7 am.  Overall it was a train wreck.  On the positive side, the credited us 50% for the night, but frankly I would have gladly paid full price to not have to move after attending a wedding on premise.

510,2,5,"My friends warned me about staying here, after I made my reservations, but I lived to give this review. The hotel is very close to the West Towne Mall, and right off the betline, which is awesome, and I got it for $60 a night. With that said, it was unsettling to walk in through two different doors and see people smoking in large groups. When it comes down to it, for $20 more I feel like I could have gotten a good night's sleep at a different hotel, or I could have stayed at a friend's house for free. The walls are paper-thin, you can hear everything outside the window, and they don't even offer a blow dryer. Make no mistake, this is a hotel for day laborers.
I'm happy to have stayed here to offer this updated review, and I'm happy to try different hotel next time I'm in town.

Check in was quick. Staff was friendly, helpful and cheerful which can be a rarity these days.

Rooms:
Ours was the perfect size. I wish they would have had a table and chairs instead of the over sized and outta place ottoman and chair. Not a biggie though. There was a desk and a chair.

Bathroom was decent. The ceiling could use a paint touch up and some of the towels need to be retired because they have seen their time. Pretty clean which is a must for me. This one was thankfully clean. Bathtub was a little icky on the floor, but it was still clean. High pressure shower head a big plus.

Beds are okay. Pillows are too soft and bulky, but fine for our stay.

On site restaurant.

Indoor waterpark is okay. It's not overly huge. There are a few slides and it's more tailored for little kids which is what we needed it for. Heavy, heavy chlorine smell and about 200 degrees inside, but cute for little kids.

Shuttle service is nice, but it's just faster in a car. The shuttle does not leave at all hours. At least the one we took. So one day we had to wait around an hour just to get back which really sucked, but it wasn't the end of the world.

513,2,1,"My experience started with pulling into the hotel parking garage. The ceilings are so low in some places with plumbing hanging down that I had to stop and get out of my mid-size truck a couple of times just to make sure I wouldn't scrape the ceiling. I did notice some scrape marks on the ceiling so I would be extra careful about parking here with a full size truck.

The room was clean and well kept, the beds were comfortable. Unfortunately, the display on the thermostat was broken so I wasn't able to adjust it reliably to get my room to a comfortable temperature. When I tried to call the front desk, the button on the phone didn't do anything. The first morning I noticed the alarm clock going off at 6:35am, housekeeping must have forgotten to turn the alarm off after the previous guest checked out. Luckily I was already up at that time so it didn't bother me too much. Sadly, I forgot to turn it off and the next morning when I tried to sleep in I got a nasty surprise at 6:35am again, my own fault I suppose.

It offered a lovely view, but it was so constantly packed with people that there weren't ever any seats open so we couldn't actually enjoy it. Three floors of the hotel are part of the club, which I think is two floors more than the club can handle.

527,5,0,"Easily one of my favorite hotels anywhere. Let's start with the building and the rooms: a quick glance should tell you how you're going to feel about it, as the whole modern and minimalist feel with concrete everywhere isn't for everyone. But if you are into that, it's fantastic. The rooms look and feel like you should be paying a lot more a night.

While the style is what drew me for my first stay, the people were the reason I knew I had to come back. Quite literally everyone I interacted with was wonderful. Whether it was the manager, the front desk staff, the bartenders, shuttle drivers, or housekeeping, every single one of them was pleasant, easy to talk to, and made me feel at home very quickly.

Since it's a smaller hotel, staff is pretty minimal, which for me is a perk - you'll recognize everyone after a day or two. Better yet, they'll know you. My first stay was a few weeks ago, and this time around I was immediately recognized at the airport, people remembered my name and conversations we had, the manager introduced himself, etc. Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about the staff and how incredibly welcoming they all are.

The only ""complaint"" I have is that it's a bit far from downtown, just shy of two miles on foot. But if the weather is nice, it's a pleasant walk. They also offer the perk of free bicycle rentals through the city bike share program, so between that and the shuttle it's easy to make your way to the capital. Also on the topic of the shuttle - they do provide complimentary to and from to Epic if that's what you're here for, and on your last day they'll bring your bags and get you from Epic and get you to the airport.

537,5,1,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel! Beautiful lobby with modern furnishings, and the staff was very welcoming at check-in. Loved the complementary truffle!  So delicious! 
I stayed in a room that I believe is probably the least expensive one they have, and it was still stunning. Definitely not your typical hotel room, more like staying in a cool concrete loft like you would see in downtown Chicago or New York. Full kitchen with impressive minibar full of snacks and drinks, large sectional sofa, beautiful lighting and decor, and a large furnished patio. Very modern, artistic furnishings, but still cozy and comfortable. Beautiful bathroom with a large shower and Aveda products.  I travel to Madison for business fairly regularly, and this is by far the most chic hotel I have found here. 
I also had dinner in the restaurant. Service was very friendly and attentive. Wine list was unique. Craft cocktail list was a bit disappointing compared to other restaurants of the same caliber here in Madison. I tried several small plates, and they were all tasty. They offer a very reasonable happy hour selection of appetizers and drinks. There is also a nice outdoor patio for the restaurant.

541,4,11,"This is a hotel that doesn't have a big name attached to it. Independent/boutique in nature, initially, I was a little skeptical in booking because I didn't know how consistently reputable the quality would be. My leap of faith laid in the hands of the reviews, I didn't see the need to stay at a higher end hotel for only one night, and the location was ideal - Mad Concourse it is! Thankfully the reviews didn't let me down! 

The extended hand of hospitality began the day after booking. A wonderful amenity is that they send an email allowing you to check in on-line several days in advance. They ask for estimated time of arrival along with any requests you might have and take down your credit card for incidentals. Aware not guaranteed, I requested early check-in that was four hours earlier than regular check-in and a view of the Capitol building. 

Admitting upon arrival, I slightly had my fingers crossed hoping for the best. My first impression when walking in was positive. The lobby was sleek yet not cheesy and comfortable. I let my guard down. We purchased parking for $10 with in/out privileges. Reviews were accurate, parking lot ceiling was low but I did still see SUV's and vans manage fine. We did not do the $50 upgrade for the Governor's Club because we had a list of restaurants we wanted to try. Starbucks and Circ are located next to the lobby. Room service is available but I was kind of astonished at the expected 19% automatic gratuity, plus regular tax on top of that. Kind of a lot! 

Our room was cozy and stylish. Two double beds were super comfy, w/ three pillows per bed and a round throw pillow. Corner table, plush chair, desk mini fridge, tv, blow dryer, coffee maker, Bath & Body Works toiletries, all glass shower, and vanity area with stool. Best of all, as I drew back the curtains, there was a magnificent unobstructed view of the Capitol Building! Yay! Both of my requests were granted! I was already loving the service and quality of this hotel! Slightly disappointed in the slow internet and lag when changing the tv channels but not a big deal.

Pool, sauna, and ping pong room were clean. Pool was heated and the water temp was very enjoyable. Lots of places to sit and extra towels to grab. Fitness center had weights, bikes, ellipticals, and treadmills. There was about 9 people up early around 6 am when I went to work out. Loved that the machines had built in fans and tv's. 

Overall, staff was very friendly, welcoming, and helpful in giving directions. Prime location within walking distance to everything on the square.

The rooms were clean and updated to a point.  We had a slight facilities issue in that our shower drain was super slow, so you'd be up to mid-calf in water within 10 minutes.  It was a short stay, so we didn't bother to see if it could be fixed and instead just reported it at check-out.  The conference area is relatively nice with a variety of room sizes, including a large ballroom.  The catering staff was fantastic, and I genuinely enjoyed the variety of meal options throughout my stay.

544,3,10,"Decent enough hotel.

We get to Madison 3 or 4 times a year, so we've stayed at most of the hotels at least once. Our current favorite, HotelRed, was booked the weekend we were going, so we decided to try the Concourse for this past trip, conveniently located just steps from the Capitol.

Rates were reasonable enough on hotels.com (your mileage may vary) and happily wi-fi is included in the price. Overnight parking runs just $10; coming from Chicago where overnight hotel parking can top $60, I find that to be quite inexpensive.

Speaking of parking, there were several events happening in or very near the hotel: a wedding, Art Fair on the Square, Fete du Marquette, and regular weekend visitors, so that meant parking in the hotel garage was a bit challenging and maddening. As hotel guests, we shouldn't have had to park in a questionable spot (literally the only one we could find after driving around for twenty minutes) that came with a warning of ""possibly"" being blocked in. Luckily we weren't. How can a hotel not have enough spots for its guests? How about not letting non-hotel guests park there? That was annoying.

The hotel is retro, mostly in a good way, but also in a ""needs refreshing"" kind of way. The room itself was fine; bed was comfortable. The sink was separate from the toilet/shower area. I much prefer the sink/shower area separate from the toilet, because, you know.

The hotel staff was very nice. We asked for an early check-in (almost 4 hours!) and it was happily granted. On the flip side, we asked for a late check-out, and that too was no problem. That earns big points. Elevators, on the other hand,  are slow and too few.

546,2,0,"Pros: Check in process is fast, free wifi in the room, free parking.
Cons:
1. Obviously I was not the only one who had bad experience with the front desk and taxi reservation. I asked the front desk the evening before my check out (the following morning). I made a taxi reservation for 5AM, the desk clerk put it on the log. The following morning, I called at 4:45AM just to make sure if they called the taxi. To my unpleasant surprise, the front desk (a different person BTW), told me that the taxi driver had been waiting at the lobby (??). I clarified that my reserved the taxi for 5AM and I would be ready at 5AM. Two mistakes: he lectured me on being late, so to speak and that he could not guarantee to get another taxi if the driver decided to leave. ALL WITHOUT CHECKING THE LOG BOOK. Secondly, even if I was a tardy customer, he (the front desk) should have handled the problem by trying to keep the driver stay, not by lecturing me on being late (I have a military precision life style so being lectured on tardiness really pushed my button). To make the event even worse, the taxi driver told me that he was fashionably early and that he knew that I would come down at 5AM (So the front desk did not ask the driver either). It was 15 minutes of hellish start of my day.
2. The room cleaning crew did not remove the trash from 1 trash can that happened to have banana peel in it. My room did not smell good when I returned in the evening. Even though it was not good, I still think it was just an isolated incident.

549,5,2,"Really, really impressed with this spot.

HotelRED is a stand-alone boutique hotel located right across the street from Camp Randall. I was seeking a unique and fun spot for a weekend getaway and this MORE than fit the bill. Accommodations were on point and the staff went above and beyond to make it special. Let me count the ways:

1. I had casually mentioned to the staff that it was a birthday trip when I originally made the booking. When checking in, we received complimentary cocktails, chocolates, and a birthday wish. In the room, a birthday card awaited along with some special chocolate covered strawberries as a treat in the fridge. Awesome! And totally unexpected.
2. Shuttle service is provided free of charge within a 3 mile radius. Easily made a booking for a 7:30 dinner pick-up. When we arrived at the desk for our ride, Seth, the driver, recognized my name/voice from when I'd called earlier in the week to confirm the room. ""Oh, hey, Kelly! Happy birthday!"" Seriously? Awesome. He was friendly and we enjoyed chatting with him on the ride to dinner (PRO TIP: GET THEE TO PIG IN A FUR COAT).
3. We had the pleasure of staying in the Capitol Suite - a one bedroom, modern setting featuring a living room, kitchenette, fabulous spa bathroom, and large bedroom. AND a huge patio. The patio overlooks the stadium and you can even see the state capitol in the distance. Everything was neat, clean, trendy, and comfortable. This suite features a nice tub in the bedroom area along with an incredible spa shower. Seriously relaxing. Little touches like nice robes and slippers upon request really made an impression.
4. AVEDA PRODUCTS provided. LADIES, YOU FEEL ME.
5. Free parking! Free Wi-Fi!

551,2,3,"I stayed here for a conference in September and stayed in a concourse room.  I was unimpressed with the hotel.

The lobby would most likely be magnificent if it were bigger.  There is a grand staircase as the centerpiece but it feels like the whole lobby was mini scale. 

My room was on the 5th floor.  When I got off the elevator I immediately noticed an ""old"" smell - like an old persons house.  The decor was incredibly dated, I'm guessing 50's? And not in a kitschy way, this was probably a nice hotel the year my parents were born.  

My room was no better.  Ancient decor, funky smells.  The only nice thing was the size.  It was a spacious room however I cannot understand why the bathroom was so small.  You had to straddle the toilet to open the door.  

The beds were incredibly soft so if that's your thing, you'll be ok.  Either way, you will find it impossible to sleep due to the freight train like HVAC unit in the room.  Not onlynwas it as loud as a jet every time it kicked on, it was maddening to set.  It was slow to respond and inconsistent with the temperature.  I would be comfortable and then all of a sudden it was blazing hot in the room.

The shower was adequate but had low pressure.  The size of the bathroom really was a downside.  But since you can't leave the door open and shower - you would not be able to exit the shower - they did have fans in the bathroom.  That helped with the humidity.

I ordered room service one night and the food was average.  I ordered hummus & pitas and a white bean burger.  The hummus was good, though a little thick.  The burger was decent.  The bun was fantastic.  The burger needed something, I just  couldn't place what it needed.  It was delivered incredibly fast.  They told me 20 minutes but it was delivered in less than 10.

561,1,0,"We used the Sheraton as our hotel block for our wedding and ran into multiple problems with them not keeping their promises.

First: 10 months before the wedding, our first block of 10 rooms was already booked, so we asked to block another set of 10 rooms.  The hotel ended up completely booked before our block was filled up, which is not their fault - CrossFit was happening at the Alliant Energy Center.  But a week before the wedding, when getting the list of people staying in the hotel so we could figure out welcome bags, we found out she had only blocked 5 more rooms, rather than the 10 we had specifically requested.  At first, they didn't offer anything to make up for this at all - it could not have been a miscommunication on my part, the e-mail specifically said we wanted 10 more rooms, and the response said ""I blocked more rooms"".  It took sending my very angry maid of honor and bridesmaid to talk to them before they offered a free night for me at the hotel.

Next: My parents booked a room at the Sheraton, as did I.  I very specifically requested that these rooms not be right next to each other.  It didn't make sense to me that the bride and groom would share a wall with the bride's parents.  I was told this was no problem.  Guess what happened when we checked in.  They did offer a free bottle of champagne to make up for this blunder.

Finally: the aforementioned free night mistakenly went to my parents' room rather than mine, but the folks at the front desk couldn't figure out why I was paying full price (my parents were checking out the next day, we didn't see their bill).  When the manager called me to clarify what was happening and I expressed my frustration, she was extremely unprofessional and confrontational.

I chose this location because of the indoor water slide and pool. If you are looking for a water park, this is not it. It's relatively small but suitable for kids ranging from 3-12. My 10 yr old nephew and 7 yr old daughter thoroughly enjoyed it.

566,3,5,"A very good value. I would definitely recommend staying here while in Mad-town, especially if seeing a show at the coliseum. It is a decent hotel practically across the street from the venue. It has all the amenities you could want and has been renovated. I personally think the lobby is as nice as some of the 4-stars I have stayed at.

Even if you are not coming to this Midwestern charmer of a town for a show, it is a great option. Some of the updates were done too quickly (wallpaper lines could be seen on the walls in our room, for example), and it is a little further from State Street, but it has a nice lobby, proper amenities, and a good pool and workout room. Plus the beds are plushly made.

To make up for the distance from ""town,"" they have an on site restaurant (haven't tried it), room service, a lounge, and Starbucks coffee bar in the lobby as well as in the rooms. I use my Starwood membership ""cash & points"" option and feel like running around the lobby yelling WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER! every time.

569,4,3,"Not bad, not bad at all! I'm very happy to have a new alternative to Best Western, Doubletree, Concourse and the few other options on or close to campus (walking distance). Great location, across the street from the Fieldhouse and Camp Randall, HotelRed is a great addition to Madison. 

My wife and I came here for a night to get away from Chicago and do something for a couple days.  Finding nothing at the last minute in Madison I stumbled upon HotelRed and the website really sold us. The rooms are very cheap for a regular king room and the prices are cheap for suites. The hotel and the rooms was an old converted series of storefronts and apartments, I believe, so the hotel has a very industrial feel to it. Cement walls and contemporary furnishings give this place a different feel from most hotels. The rooms are almost loft-style.  

Even the simple king room had a two-burner stove top, a dishwasher, sink, coffee maker, fridge full of beer (great selection including New Glarus), SmartWater, juice, and pop and then some snacks on the counter (all for purchase). The shower is pretty damn cool with three different settings (rainhead, across the shower and the handheld.  Overall, the bathrooms are pretty nice and they give you some good toiletries to use.

The bed is ultra comfortable from the matress to the pillows to the down comforter in a duvet. Nice 42"" LG flatscreens on the wall with a decent channel lineup make the rooms fairly comfortable.  The king rooms also have a desk, drawers and a standalone single comfy chair. Also, your rooms will have an iron and ironing board.

The bar downstairs serves food but we didn't try anything as we were set on Greenbush Bar. We came back to the bar after eating to have a couple drinks rather than go to a college bar (we're 31, no more crazy Madtown bars for me). The bar was nice and the beer selection was decent. Adequate hard liquor selection but the wine list was a bit lacking.  Not much of an atmosphere because it was fairly empty and the bartenders were new (as the hotel was only open two months at the time) but it was low-key and they had sports on the TVs and music playing. The lights were a little too bright tho.

I look forward to going back all year long.  Their staff is incredibly nice and well-trained, the rooms are lovely and clean and comfortable, the restaurants are pretty good but the hotel is so near lots of amazing outside restaurants that you have plenty of choice, and they have free Internet.  

If you have the budget for it, book a room on the Governor's Level.  You won't be disappointed.  Not only do you get a slightly higher level of service, you get access to the Governor's Lounge where they serve free continental breakfast, snacks and cookies throughout the day, appetizers in the evenings, and really nice baked goods for desert.  Plus, they have a free bar which is actually free, no strings attached.  And the bartender is such a wonderful guy.  he deserves all the tips we give him and more.

As I said, the hotel is right near lots of great restaurants as well as Madison's new museum.  You're blocks away from the capital building and some book stores and the University.  The hotel provides a shuttle from the airport, so if you don't need to go anywhere specific in town, you don't need to rent a car.  If you're there on a Saturday, go tot he farmer's market around the capitol.  It's really amazing.

I have nothing bad to say about this hotel.

The carpet was a bit worm (but clean) and it just looked like it hadn't been touched up to bring it up to make it look refreshed. Yet was the room great for us? YES! The room is tight with the addition of the bunk bed space but there was a nicely sized closet and my son loved the bunk bed and being able to watch movies in ""his room"".

As an alumna, I was excited to return to campus and book my stay at Hotel Red, especially since we could bring our 6 year old black lab. However, I left very disappointed by the end of my stay. 

The room was beautiful and spacious. The people seemed friendly enough, albeit not very accommodating when I asked for simple things like band aids. The sheets very terribly itchy. And during the entire length of my stay, they didn't change the bedding or make the bed or pick up anything around the room. We were running out of towels and I was getting nervous about the cleanness of the hotel. 

Here's the kicker: WE LEFT ON SUNDAY WITH FLEAS.  Our dog has fleas everywhere and I had multiple bites. In our years of owning pets this has never happened before. I know our room was a pet friendly room, and you run a certain risk there, but i thought they would have at least thought to WASH THE COMFORTER AND BEDDING before the next guest stayed in order to avoid situations like this.

600,2,10,"My girlfriend and I recently stayed at this Sheraton. It was our first time with one and perhaps our last. Needless to say, my experience there was very disappointing. 

Let me start off by saying that the staff members were super friendly, and I have no qualms with them. (Much love to those holding it down at the front.) My gripes mainly pertain to the terrible smell of the lobby and our poorly maintained room.

When we entered the building, a putrid stench seemed to fill the lobby. According to my girlfriend, it reminded her of an unkept women's bathroom. (Shiver.) I think this problem could be easily fixed if the cleaning staff used a different solution. This is a bit more forgivable, since it was mainly in one area.

What I can't overlook was the room. We arrived late that day, and for paying something over $130ish per night, you would expect that we wouldn't have to worry about the room's cleanliness or functionality. And sure, I guess I could've called the front staff to get us another, but really, do I want to go through all that hassle at 11 PM when I have to wakeup early the next morning? No. I also discovered some of these problems the next day, so there really wasn't much I could do.

Things that could be better:
-The curtain was detached from the wall that left a long nail out.
-There were only a few visible outlets (that didn't have lamps connected to them), and only one of them worked. That was the one by the sink.
-The smatter of bird crap across our window.
-An unnerving sign that stated, ""Due to our proximity to Lake Monona, there are often natural lake flies that penetrate the window screens. For your own comfort, we ask that the windows be kept closed. Your cooperation is appreciated and we apologize for any inconvenience."" I guess that's kind of nice, but it just looked like someone made it on Microsoft Word and taped it to the window. 
-And for the finale, our king sized bed didn't have proper fitted bed sheets. In fact, it was mainly two non-fitted sheets tucked into the mattress. It absolutely sucked waking up on the actual mattress, which I found absolutely disgusting. I cleansed myself with a cold shower.

609,4,8,"Great hotel, and if you're in Madison for a Badgers game (Go Bucky!), the location can't be beat (it's right across from Camp Randall). 

Small, modern, boutique hotel, with nice amenities and an incredibly wonderful staff. We were given an early check-in and late check-out without any problem.

For starters, they offer free parking AND free wi-fi, so right off the bat, I'd be inclined to stay here over most other places in the area. They also offer a free shuttle service to anywhere within a three-mile radius. That certainly comes in handy as there can be some difficulty in parking in Madison. We used the shuttle to go to the Farmers' Market and it worked out perfectly.

The hotel is pet-friendly, and there's a bowl of treats and  a ""welcome"" sign with your pet's name on it in the lobby. I thought that was super cute. I imagine on a busy day, the sign would say ""Welcome Sparky, Lucy, Hunter, Fluffy, Charlie, etc.""

The room itself was wonderful. There's a small kitchenette with a two-burner range, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator and REAL dishes, silverware and glassware. They even had champagne glasses so we could enjoy our Veuve Clicquot properly. The honor bar features locally made products and liquors.(I so wanted to scoop up the adorable mini bottles of Death's Door gin and vodka, but at $11 apiece, I decided against it.)

The bathroom had a separate toilet area, which is always appreciated, especially when you're not traveling solo. The European Spa shower was pretty amazing too, once I figured it out. There were so many handles and levers, that at first I thought I was in an airport hangar and not a shower. 

The rooms have concrete walls and floors so the floor can get chilly, but they offer complimentary slippers to all guests. There's a small fitness center on the premises and complimentary grocery pick up from a local store. Be sure and check out ""The Wise,"" the hotel's restaurant and bar for some tasty vittles and cocktails. There's even an outside patio that I can't wait to check out in the summer.

The only negatives I have would be that for a hotel that prides itself on being ""green,"" it was dismaying to see the dishwasher running when we checked into our room, but with no dishes at all inside. And despite hanging our towels up after use so they wouldn't be replaced (as instructed), we still were given new towels. I also didn't like the fact they only had Coffee-Mate creamer and not ""real"" cream--we're in Wisconsin! If you're going for an upscale feel and have Keurig brewers in each room, then methinks you should not have imitation dairy products. I realize I'm probably splitting hairs, but I just can't stomach non-dairy creamer in my morning joe.

I loved this hotel and it's definitely going to be our first choice when staying in Madison. Of course, I may feel differently staying here during a Badgers home game, because I imagine it's an entirely disparate experience.

619,3,1,"The Sheraton Madison is a perfectly adequate business travel hotel. Yes, there are a few frayed elements to the hotels ""total package"" - but the positive elements out-weigh the negative in a resounding way.

A few things to consider - (1) It's a Sheraton. By that statement I mean - the Sheraton Madison is a mid-range, travel hotel. It is not a resort hotel or even a high-end business travel hotel. Guests should consider the class of hotel before they book a stay at the Sheraton (and especially when writing acerbic reviews). (2) The location is outside of the downtown core - but restaurants and amenities are easily accessible. In fact, the hotel has one of the most robust shuttle services to the downtown and the airport I have ever seen. Case in point, my co-worker landed a few hours before me (I rented a car). She called the hotel to request the shuttle. They told her the shuttle had already left the airport - but that she should get in a cab and tell the driver to charge the fare to the Sheraton. Wow. have you ever heard of such great customer service? (3) The hotel needs a little remodeling. The decor is clean and maintained, but there is definitely a need for a little more contemporary features. (4) The staff are super pleasant and very responsive to requests. I am a SPG Platinum member. I stay in SPG properties 75+ nights per year. The staff at the Sheraton Madison were some of the nicest staff I have encountered. 

And finally, (5) The Sheraton Madison is a mid-range business travel hotel. I know - I have already stated such; but it is super important to keep this in-kind if you are looking to book a more luxurious hotel for your staff in the Madison area.

623,5,1,"What a great place, I will be coming back.

I have only stayed with the Governor's Club upgrade, so can only comment on that experience. For a reasonable upgrade fee (very decent if you have AAA) you can access an upper floor lounge with free cocktails, snacks, and breakfast. Great view, and a nice place to have a couple drinks while you plan your evening.

Years ago we stayed on Thanksgiving and had an excellent and sumptuous holiday buffet included in our upgrade as well. I'm not sure if that happens every year but I would find it a no-brainer destination if you wanted a more intimate holiday celebration with all the trimmings and a festive atmosphere.

We got comped a room-service bottle of champagne while celebrating a wedding anniversary soon, which was thoughtful. Room and beds were clean and nicely done. I usually don't pay too much attention to the TVs in hotels, but the flat screen we had in our room was incredible.

The only minor problems we had were with the key-cards being rather tweaky in the elevators. It took some time to get them to work. All the staff we encountered were wonderful.

In summary I would say spend the money on the Governor's Club upgrade and give yourself some extra time to enjoy feeling like a VIP.",The Madison Concourse Hotel and Governor's Club,1 W Dayton St,53703,4.0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False'}","Venues & Event Spaces, Event Planning & Services, Caterers, Hotels, Hotels & Travel, Party & Event Planning"

630,1,0,"I recently stayed here with my boyfriend overnight on my last night in Madison. We checked in, after being given many judgmental looks by all the people working behind the desk. Our room was very nice, with a beautiful shower, kitchenette and king bed. We needed to connect to the wifi almost immediately in order to work. We were given instructions and a wifi password, however it did not work. We tried several times on our own, read the manual and tried on our mobiles as well as our laptops. We called down to the front desk to tell them that we were having problems connecting. The woman at the front desk referred us back to the piece of paper with the password on it. We explained we had already tried it and she suggested we were doing it wrong and to try again. After two more calls to the front desk, we finally went down. We connected our laptops in the lobby, but the connection would not last as soon as we got back into our rooms. Extremely frustrating, but we dealt with it. Onto dinner time, where we ordered a burger and chicken and waffles for room service. We specified no onions on the burger as I am extremely allergic, and they asked if we wanted bacon on the burger (an extra 3$). We said no. We get a call that they are out of chicken and waffles, so we added the sliders instead. They come up 45 minutes later with a cold burger, extremely undercooked and a soggy bun with onions AND bacon on them. We called down to fix the order. They finally came back up 30 minutes after that with a burger. It was fine, but the cheese was not melted and the bun was still soggy. They offered us ONE breakfast item for free the next morning. Really? The following morning we called to the front desk to see if we could extend our checkout time as we had to run a few errands before heading to the airport and they said they would call us back within the hour to let us know. We waited around for 2 hours to hear back. She finally called us and said ""you were supposed to checkout a half hour ago"". Well, lady, you never called us back! If you want a cool hotel room with no wifi, this is a good place for you. If you want bad service, rude/oblivious staff then stay here.

As an Epic guest I got access to the 7th floor which had free food and drinks and a nice place to hang out or do work. The hotel rooms were decent. The food was pretty good as well. I will not be returning because of the shuttle driver. Not only did he ask for tips which was very unprofessional but he also got angry when the $2 was not enough. Me and a colleague were followed into the lobby and confronted about our $2 tip (which was all the cash we had). He told us that he wanted at least $5 and that we could have taken a cab. Once the incident was over we reported his behavior to the front desk supervisor who apologized an offered us a drink at the bar which we declined. Later that night I called the front desk to make sure the issue was addressed and I wouldn't have trouble taking the shuttle to epic the next morning. I was told by the front desk manager that he spoke to the driver. After a brief awkward pause he said ""I don't know what else you want me to do. I'm not going to fire him.""

634,4,3,"A great stay in a great hotel.

I stayed in the Governor's Club portion of the Concourse for a business trip in Madison.  

The room was decent:  comfortable bed, nice view, lathery soap, and only a couple carpet stains.

I got an excellent rate for the Governor's Club floors by mentioning that I was in town to visit [big clinical testing lab company*].  Being in the Governor's Club** has its privileges:  free breakfast buffet and 6 hours of complimentary drinks, including Spotted Cow and top-shelf liquor with really solid hors d'oeuvres every night.  Top that, my Kimpton friends and your one hour of beer n' wine.

Staff was helpful in pointing out local attractions and breweries and whatnot.

Parking for hotel isn't clearly indicated: it's down the ramp prior to the hotel entrance.  Clearance is supposedly 6'2""; still, I had to duck from banging my melon on a pipe, and I wasn't even wearing heels.

If in Madison again, I'd definitely stay at this hotel again.

* I'm not going to mention the name of the company, but maybe you can figure it out and get the Gov Club for the cost of a regular room.  And speaking of which, next time you travel anywhere, look up some of the biggest companies in the area, then call your hotel and request a company's corporate rate.  Nobody can prove you're *not* going there for business, and you'll get a great deal and many bonuses.  Obviously, this won't work for stays over New Year's Eve or Mardi Gras or in Cancun, but works fine for the Springfields and so forth in the US of A.

Unfortunately did not get to use the air tub as we spent less time at the hotel than expected.  Staff was very professional, courteous.  If bellmen are available, they WILL shuttle you to nearby locations.  We went to Sardine for dinner and it was going to be 20 min for shuttle, so we took a cab, but we called for ride back and they had the shuttle there within 5 min, and driver was so apologetic he couldn't take us to dinner.  

Room was very nice.  Bed and pillows were super comfortable.  Granite topped tables.  Refrigerator but no microwave.  NICE glasses (I hate staying in a hotel where the glasses for water, etc are tiny).  Free bottled water.  Bath and Body Works lotion, shampoo, etc.  Nice big flat screen tv, with in room movies.  Oh, and the view of the Capitol was amazing.  Couldn't hear too much noise from other rooms.

Finally, the Governor's Club.  Free breakfast, hor d'ouerves, dessert, and drinks.  Only had drinks here one night, but the bartender made a spot on brandy old fashioned sweet.  Hor d'ouerves were good, as were the desserts, although the one night I got dessert, there was hardly anything there at 9:15 when I went down (supposed to start at 9) and I went back later and still nothing refreshed.  Breakfast the two days I went there had a large assortment of pastries, fruit, cereal, bagels/bread, scrambled eggs, french toast, and juice.  Had the eggs, which were great.

The two main drawbacks to me:  1) No icemakers on the floors, you have to call for ice, which I dislike.  2)  No in room safe.  For a fancy hotel, I think an in room safe is standard.

I could have booked a hotel closer to campus, but I haven't had a bad experience at a Starwood property, so far.  I am very dissatisfied with the lack of customer service that this hotel provides.  On Saturday when I arrived, I asked to reserve the shuttle at 7:30am to take me to campus from Monday through Thursday.  The Front Desk told me that Monday and Tuesday were unavailable because of the Epic Systems guests.  That's two days where I will have to take a taxi.

On Tuesday evening, I called to confirm my shuttle reservation for Wednesday, and the Front Desk told me that they were serving the Epic guests all week and that the shuttle was unavailable.  That meant that I would have to take a taxi all week.  The Front Desk agent was very negligent because they did NOT inform me that the shuttle was unavailable for my reservation.  They could easily have left a message.  Had I not called the Front Desk, I would have found out too late that my shuttle was unavailable, and I would have to scramble to find a taxi and perhaps be late for my course.  I expressed my discontent with the Front Desk, but he did not express any empathy.  The shuttle was reserved for Epic for that time, period.

Imagine my fiancee's surprise then when the Front Desk called on Wednesday morning asking where I was for my shuttle.  The Front Desk agent from Tuesday obviously did not even check the shuttle log when he said it was unavailable.

At least that meant I would be able to take the shuttle on Thursday morning.  Well, on that morning, the Front Desk called letting me know that the shuttle driver was stuck in traffic, and that she would call me a cab (which I ended up paying for again).  For the four days when I needed the shuttle in the morning, it was not available, and I paid for the cab every morning from Monday through Thursday.

For the Make a Green choice, it states on the door hang to hang the notice before 2am.  I did that, but I did not receive my voucher the first night.  I asked the Front Desk and she stated that the hang has to be on the door by 10pm the night before because that's when the security walks around for it.   I said that I thought it was 2am, but I wasn't sure if that was for the Green Choice or the breakfast room service.  She gave me the voucher anyway as if she were doing me a favour.  I checked the door hang, and she was incorrect.

On checkout day, I made a reservation for the shuttle to take me to the airport.  She entered me in the log for 4:45pm.  The shuttle was again not available at that scheduled time, but at least they took care of the cab fare for that one trip.

The recommendations for restaurants were great and the complimentary shuttle made getting to and from downtown Madison a breeze.

My only suggestion to the management would be to have the custodial services staff follow the ""green"" procedures of not replacing towels which were hung to dry.  A minor request which in no way significantly marred our experience.

668,5,2,"I received an email 6 days prior to my arrival asking me to fill out a brief form noting my expected arrival time and whether I would have a car to park at the hotel ($10/night), etc. 

I called the hotel from the airport on my mobile (I couldn't find the courtesy phones in the baggage claim area). A lady answered the phone and I told her I wanted the shuttle. She asked if I had my bags already and when I said yes she took down my name and mobile number. She then put me on a brief hold saying she had to check on the ETA of the shuttle. The phone was on hold for a few moments then rang again and the same lady answered again like it was an outside call coming in. I told her it was still me waiting and she said there must not be anyone at the Bell Desk. She told me to take a taxi to the hotel and that the hotel would pick up the tab. In the taxi when I told the driver where I was going he guessed that the hotel was picking up the tab. Apparently it is a common occurrence for the bellmen / shuttle drivers to be unavailable. It was very nice of the hotel to not make me wait at the airport for them to be available I thought! 

I arrived at the hotel at 10:30am (I had told them that would be my arrival time via the pre-arrival survey they sent me). There was one staff person at the desk upon my arrival so I had a brief wait while he finished with another guest checking out. I was quickly checked in. During the process the man asked if I wanted a high or lower floor room. I said high and requested a capitol view. 

I went up to my room and my key would not work. The housekeeper in the hall could not get it to work either. She went to call down to the front desk saying she would have someone bring me a new key, but she came back and told me I had to go downstairs to get it myself (the bellmen must have still been missing?). 

Room: I booked a Governor's Club room and I was given room 1432. I was given just the room the man checking me in said he would give me. It was on a high floor (I was on the top of the three Governor's level floors: 11, 12 & 14) and I had a capitol view and it was a corner room (read: larger than normal) to boot! While the top three floors of the hotel house the Governor's Club rooms the lounge is on the 12th floor.  

The room was spacious being a corner room. The king bed was comfy. There was an ottoman, circular table, floor lamp and two armchairs in the window next to the bed. This was all comfortably spaced out and not smashed in the corner. Opposite this seating area there was a desk with wheeling chair. At the foot of the bed was a dresser with fridge (it's hidden in the dresser paneled like a drawer). To the right of that was another ottoman and still in the closet there was a luggage rack. The room was comfortably appointed in furnishings and colors and was really nice. Plugs were plentiful in the lamps, desk and wall by the seating area. The bathroom was spacious. This room had a jacuzzi tub instead of a walk in shower, but it was newly tiled. Lotion, shampoo and conditioner were provided. Turndown service which included chocolates and bottled water was done each night. 

Gym: The gym was spacious with a cable machine, dumbbells and a bench, a wall of cardio machines, and floor space to use the med balls, bosu ball, mat, or swiss balls. The gym is on floor three, not accessible off the Governor's separate elevator. 

Lounge:
The lounge offers breakfast M-F 6:30a-9:30a and Sa-Su 7a-11a. Hors d'oeuvres are served 5:30p-10:30 and free alcohol (rare for a club lounge - i.e., it almost never happens at Hyatt's Regency Clubs) is served 4:30p-10:30p and dessert and drinks/coffee 9p-10:30p. 

The food selection for hors d'oeuvres one night was a nacho bar with beans, chicken, pico, salsa, lettuce, and cheese. Prior to that being set out there were cookies and a coffee / tea station. At night for desserts there were still cookies and two more dessert options. Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, fatty bacon, bakery, cold cereal, juices and toasts. 

During my stay the lounge was pretty empty and I was able to bring my laptop down and work during the day and be the only person in the lounge. Bring a sweater though because for me the lounge was freezing! That aside there is plenty of comfortable seating. There is a couch area for a large group, a bar for singles, and several two top tables with a great view for couples. 

The upgrade is so worth it. There's a key card only elevator guaranteeing express service to the 12-14 floors with no other stops. There is free, unlimited alcohol from 4:30-11:30! The view is amazing! The price difference from the regular rooms was about $30 a night.  

Location: The hotel's location is amazing! The capitol is just one block to the south. State street and all its shops are just one block to the west.

Nearly every employee my partner and I encountered -- from check-in to check-out -- was unfriendly, seemed irritated and verged on explicitly rude. Our presence from start to finish felt like an inconvenience. The one exception from the front desk clerk we dealt with at checkout, who was kind despite the long wait we dealt with at the desk (why did they only have one person there an hour before checkout on a busy summer weekend?). 

Most pointedly, the servers and bartenders we encountered at our friend's wedding reception were extremely unfriendly. It pulled down our mood considerably at an event that's supposed to be a celebration. Our check-in clerk mumbled and never even said so much as a ""hello"" or ""welcome"" that I can recall. 

On top of that, our room -- for the rate we were paying ($160, the reduced wedding rate)-- was exceedingly average. It felt like it had been renovated in a hurry.

680,5,6,"I have a thing for boutique hotels. I like the experience of something unique. So unless the price is way out of line that's what I look for. 

The name first got my attention because red is my favorite color. I honestly was impressed in several ways. 

1. The shower. Someone else mentioned it but it earns 5 stars by itself. In hotel showers I often do not feel completely clean because you don't have a lot of control over where the water goes. This shower was wickedly awesome! Between the 30 streams on your hair and the 6 side jets and the hand wand, it was just great. 

2. The desk didn't make me feel like I needed a booster seat to use my computer. I'm not a very tall woman, and I'm often not comfortable sitting at a hotel desks. Here I was. (Wifi is free, but does require a password. I'm okay with that, but saw another reviewer who wasn't.)

3. Bed was not hard as a rock and pillows were not these tiny flat things. Bed was decently comfortable with quality sheets that did not feel like sandpaper. 

4. Coffee maker was a Keurig. Would have been nice to have filters available down at the desk so you could make better quality coffee than the provided but it's a cut above the usual. 

5. Did I mention the color scheme was black and red and rocks?

6. Nice kitchen area.

Okay the less impressive:

1.  Parking totally sucked. Got back from my meeting in Verona on Thursday and there was no where to park. 
2.  In addition, you have to walk up a steep ramp from the underground parking when you do park there, not friendly to older, less fit bones. 

3.  Least comfortable thing in the suite was the couch. It was okay, but not really great. 

Overall, I'd stay here again in a heart beat.",HotelRED,1501 Monroe St,53711,4.0,"{'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False'}","Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel"
681,4,2,"I've stayed at this Sheraton several times, most recently for a conference this September.  It's a solid small city hotel.  The beds are Sheraton beds, nice and comfy.  It has a pool (large enough to swim abbreviated laps, though not a full-size lap pool), a sauna, and a hot tub.  It's well-located -- walking distance to the Reliant Center, and only two miles from downtown.  There's ample parking.  The BBQ chicken pizza from Heartland, the attached restaurant, was tasty, though I haven't had it since 2004.  Also, the curtains in the room are very effective in shutting out the sunlight, which the vampiric among us (or simply anyone like me, who's woken up by the sunrise) will appreciate.

A few things to keep in mind: while there is wireless internet, it's not free.  The rooms don't have minibar fridges.  Those two miles to downtown may be too farther than you want to walk after a night out (though it's a short, cheap cab ride).  Make sure to check the electronic clock when you arrive to make sure the alarm is off -- the last time I stayed, they didn't reset the alarm clock after the last guest left, which punctured my last hour of sleep.

685,4,1,"This was our first time staying at this hotel, which is conveniently located near my brother's house. Usually, we stay with him but there was a big family event so we opted for a little sanity and our own bathroom this time. HotelRed is a very contemporary, minimalist boutique hotel that has everything you could really want- a cool bar, friendly, laid back employees and they are extremely dog friendly, even going so far as to have a little welcome sign chalk board, naming all of the dogs staying there, next to a treat bowl. The dog even got her own goodie bag which contained treats and poo bags. The rooms are quiet and clean, with flat screen TVs, free WiFi and the coolest showers ever! The only complaint I have with the bathrooms is that they are not really...um...private. I wouldn't go here if I were in a new relationship because the only ventilation the bathroom had came from the fact that it wasn't full enclosed- as in, it had a sliding door and kind of a loft ceiling. So you can hear pretty much everything going on in there, unless you run the water. Maybe we're prudes but that was not so great. Other than that, they have Aveda products and a kitchenette with an amazing ""honor bar."" We didn't use it because we went to the Wise Bar downstairs and had drinks but it was definitely an impressive selection of small bottles! The windows open out to a nice neighborhood view and it was pleasant to hear birds in the morning. They had free valet parking the weekend we were there but were later told it was only for a special event. Parking in general is free, though, which is great.

Honestly, I rarely opt to make any upgrades when I stay at a hotel, but my stay at The Madison Concourse was the rare exception.

There is the Edgewater with great views, but it's run down and the city won't let it be taken over by someone who may refurbish it. The Hilton Monona Terrace is beautiful, but more expensive. So, to their credit, the Concourse is cornering the market. However, because of this advantage, I feel that some things in the hotel are not looked after as they should be. 
I was allowed to stay in an adjoining room with noise levels that interrupted my sleep for 5 days before being asked if I'd like to be moved.

My coffee makers didn't function FOUR CONSECUTIVE TIMES and they kept bringing up old coffee makers that had lime/rust stains in the water chamber.

The hotel lobby is also a student study area. Not a big deal, just expect it. The hotel feels out of place and the concierges get this.

The rooms are very cold, architecturally and temperately. They're big on sustainability, which I applaud, but the choices aren't always intelligent. The heat circulates poorly, and the room apparently can never be warm in winter (no matter the thermostat). Then the bathroom is too big to be efficiently heated, and the shower is a curtain-less stall, so brace for a draft. I was surprised how dorm-like the room felt. The floor is cold tile and short rugs, some dorm-ish paraphernalia on the beds. The furniture feels cheaper than it likely actually is. The sheets were pilly. Again, the heat situation was inane. I don't know who'd build a hotel in cold Wisconsin without designing specifically for heating.

The light switch is somewhat confusing, hidden behind the makeshift closet and requiring a keycard to stay on. When you go to kill the light at night, you'll wonder who designed this inefficient system that makes you stumble around in the dark instead of using light switches, infrared beams, and timers.

Ever since being a student attending the university several years ago, I had always wanted to stay at Hotel Red. It seemed chic, clean, and I had heard the rooms were great. 

As an alumna, I was excited to return to campus and book my stay at Hotel Red, especially since we could bring our 6 year old black lab. However, I left very disappointed by the end of my stay. 

The room was beautiful and spacious. The people seemed friendly enough, albeit not very accommodating when I asked for simple things like band aids. The sheets very terribly itchy. And during the entire length of my stay, they didn't change the bedding or make the bed or pick up anything around the room. We were running out of towels and I was getting nervous about the cleanness of the hotel. 

Here's the kicker: WE LEFT ON SUNDAY WITH FLEAS.  Our dog has fleas everywhere and I had multiple bites. In our years of owning pets this has never happened before. I know our room was a pet friendly room, and you run a certain risk there, but i thought they would have at least thought to WASH THE COMFORTER AND BEDDING before the next guest stayed in order to avoid situations like this. Guess not.

Stayed at the Concourse Hotel and Governor's Club (never found out what the Governor's club is) over a Saturday night and found it to be a clean, classy hotel, with an extremely friendly staff.

We booked through Hot Wire at $77 per night.  With taxes it came to about a 100 bucks, which we thought was good considering rooms were going for $180 on their website, pre-tax.  One thing with hot wire rooms, hotels sometimes put you in the less desirable rooms.  I think this may have been the case at the Concourse.  They gave us a room on the third floor with a view away from the Capitol... but it worked out because the pool is on the third floor and the kids loved it.

Positives:  Clean room, nice decor, awesome location, super friendly staff, very nice pool, hot tub, and sauna.

The only negative was the restaurant in the hotel.  We had breakfast there on Sunday, sort of a buffet brunch thing.  Although it wasn't very expensive, for 5 of us $58, it was very unimpressive.  A world class hotel should always have a world class restaurant...just my opinion.  But there are tons of restaurants within walking distance so no worries.

A few hints:  The parking garage has an extremely low ceiling, so if you have a tall vehicle or a pick up truck like I do, be wary.  And getting out of the building on a Sunday when the hotel is booked up on Saturday night can be a bit hectic.

Overall a great experience, nice hotel, and have I mentioned in a great location (3X right).

729,1,6,"Review for the BAR only:

Oh gosh. For a moderately upscale place that does so well with its rooms and overall service, the bar service and the bartenders couldn't be more clueless. They're nice people, but desperately need training in very basic skills. A few immediate things to fix:

1. ALWAYS USE A STRAINER. Ice chunks (resulting from piss-poor bartending form) in any martini-style drink is unacceptable. This isn't even a ""craft cocktail"" thing. It's a basic thing. If you use a shaker and a glass to strain a $10 drink, you don't know what you're doing.

2. STOP SAMPLING DRINKS WITH STRAWS IN FRONT OF PATRONS. So you mix a drink (presumably from a recipe) and dip a (presumably clean) cocktail straw into it to pull a sample? Really? Wow.

3. UNDERSTAND AND MEMORIZE YOUR OWN RECIPES. An order from YOUR OWN DRINK MENU shouldn't be baffling.

4. VIRTUALLY EVERY DRINK SHOULD BE GARNISHED. When was the last time you saw an Old Fashioned properly served without any type of garnish whatsoever? Yep...NEVER.

5. LEARN HOW TO MEASURE. We watched as our two drinks poured out to about one and a half, at which point a few splishes of additional ingredients went into the shaker to top them off. OK, you can be off by a little, but not by half a drink. Again, probably just bad training and inexperience.

I'm sure this group is fine with more student-oriented drinks like beer. But if you're going to offer a higher end experience, specialty drinks and higher prices (which are all perfectly fine and appreciated in the heart of UW Student Central), you need more skills than just dumping vodka in some type of mixer.

We'll wait a while and try again.",HotelRED,1501 Monroe St,53711,4.0,"{'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False'}","Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel"

I was a bit confused when I first came in, because other Sheraton's that I have stayed in have always been more spacious. Not in like an egregious way, just a bit...roomier and less claustrophobic. Wider halls, less long walkways, just slightly wider rooms and more than exactly a human-width between twin beds, etc. My impression of Sheraton's are that they're supposed to be a cut above, say, Hampton or Holiday Inns.

The seating area is absent, which is extremely dissapointing to me.  The distinct ""living room"" area was absolutely my favorite part about the other room.  Furthermore, the bathroom (especially the shower area) is not nearly as nice.  The windows face the inside, and my room actually opened out into the hot tub.  If the pool is busy, the noise will carry into your room.  Overall, the double bed room is a big dissapointment.  I was especially dissapointed considering that the rooms are the same price, when they're not even close to the same quality.

As for other facilities, the hotel has a nice restaurant attached.  The hot tub is a nice option to have, and is rather spacious.  There's also free wireless and a cool bar in the lobby.  Priority Club Members get their safe fee refunded (yes, how incredibly nickle-and-dime is it to have a safe fee even if you dont use the in room safe??) and get two free drinks at the hotel bar.

Staff is always friendly, although I was somewhat dissapointed that the front desk employee didn't offer to see if there was an upgraded room available for me, as I belive that's fairly standard practice for hotels and their status-ed club members.

So to sum up: If you can be guaranteed a king room not facing the pool, this is a great hotel and a great value.  If you're even facing the possibility of a double bed room, I would recommend looking elsewhere.",Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Madison West,1109 Fourier Dr,53717,3.0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'}","Venues & Event Spaces, Resorts, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services"

From the location right off State Street, to the friendly, easy check-in, to the free upgrade (originally we had reserved a king room, they upgraded us to two queens and a view right in front of the Wisconsin State Capitol building. Uh, yes please) we had a great stay. One of the best parts of our entire week long vacation was when the front desk staff noticed that I was wearing an ""It's My Birthday"" sticker, they wished me a happy birthday, and I mentioned that my fiancee's birthday was the day before mine as well. No sooner do we get up to our room that hotel staff brings up a bucket of Wisconsin beer, courtesy of the hotel, with the gentleman wishing us a happy birthday. Amazing.

739,4,2,"I had to go to Madison for training classes & stayed at this hotel all three times I went up there.  The hotel itself is quite clean.  The rooms are ample.  I stayed in different suites each week I went up.  The standard suite was nice.  The door opened to the sitting area with a sofa, chair, desk and entertainment hutch.  There was a little hallway connecting this area to the bedroom area.  On one side of the hall, there was the bathroomm with a walk-in shower, on the other was a small kitchenette with microwave, mini fridge & sink.  

The second time I stayed there, I had a jacuzzi room.  The ceilings were very high and the jacuzzi sat next to the tub.   The tub was big enough to lay down & relax after class, which was nice.  

The third visit, I had a ""gallery suite"".  The door opened to a nice sized hallway (the Gallery??) that opened up into the bedroom.  The king size bed took up most of the room, along with a jacuzzi tub, chest of drawers (with a flat-panel television on top).  Another short hallway had the bathroom on one side, then opened into the living area.  The livingroom had a sofa, chair, desk, coffee table and entertainment hutch.  Beside that area was the kitched/dining area.  There was a table & chairs for 4 and a big refrigerator, microwave, sink, etc.  This living/dining area was surrounded by windows that overlooked the indoor pool.  There was a sliding door that led out to that area & a small sitting area/balcony that allowed you to access the pool area directly from your room.  

They refer to the indoor pool area as an indoor waterpark, but it's not as glamorous as it sounds.  There is a pool, and there is a rather large ""play area"" that has a ""boat"" that kids can climb around, etc.  If you have young kids, they'd probably love it.  

All the rooms were clean and quiet.  I had a good night's sleep each night I was there.  The staff were wonderful...very courtious and helpful.  Mitch, one of the managers there, was fantastic & always going the extra mile.  

If you're a Priority Club member (which if you go to Holiday Inns, you should be.  Just sign up for free on their website), you get a free drink ticket & a free breakfast buffet ticket.  They also have hot appetizers in the evening in their lobby/bar area.

The location is great, right outside of downtown with ample parking and a short, 5-minute drive to the Capitol. The lobby is nice and modern and the front desk staff was efficient and friendly.

There was a sign in the lobby that announced that rooms will be remodeled in 2017 which is good. They need it desperately. The furniture is very dated and is in ill-repair. One of our two beds felt like the frame was broken (very, very wobbly), the armoire's doors barely closed, etc. However my major issue with the room was cleanliness. There were long strands of hair stuck to the wallpaper in the bathroom, surfaces looked grimy, and there was even a used Band-Aid stuck to the side of the desk. Disgusting.

I only had two complaints. I found the parking to be very confusing. I entered an underground garage but all the spots were full. There was not a sign outside that said ""full"". I ended up pulling out of the parking lot and parked in a city lot for the day. I'm not sure if there is more than one parking garage, or if it just small..... It wasn't a big deal, but just confusing.

The only other complaint is that it took quite awhile to check in. It was about 3 in the afternoon, but they only had one staff person working at first and then a second person started after they realized a line was building. There were two weddings at the hotel that weekend and a convention, so it was quite busy.

I didn't stop at the lounge on the first floor, but it looked like a nice place to get a meal or drink.

The room was great. Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom was quite spacious and had really nice soaps/lotions, etc.

748,2,0,"This Holiday Inn seems to be what you get when someone puts the minimum necessary into designing, building and maintaining a hotel.  Because of its proximity to the Middleton Convention Center and the presence of an indoor pool with a slide, the hotel gets a steady stream of conventioneers and families, but this isn't the sort of hotel I'd seek out, in general. 

The rooms are quite dated. The bathroom is spartan, and the strange walk-in shower stall wasn't terribly clean. The aging sofa and chair were soft and in need of replacing.  Luckily, the bed was pretty good. 

On weekends, this is definitely a family hotel, so if you have a family and want to let the kiddies play in the pool, you'll like it.  That doesn't describe me or my visit, so I found the experience a little annoying. Kids were constantly running around the lobby, treating it like a playroom, and you could hear children dashing through the halls until much too late at night. 

This is the kind of hotel that feels its necessary to put up signs in the elevator lobbies warning you ""Warning: Security Cameras in Use.""  Charming. 

The overall mediocre feel of the hotel was not enhanced by the unwelcoming front desk staff. We asked for an extra hour past the 11 am check-out, but that was too great a request for this clearly bustling hotel. (That was sarcasm, in case it wasn't evident.)

749,4,2,"IN A SENTENCE
A unique hotel I'd visit again.

THE GOOD:
- Very unique, hip, industrial design.  Looks very modern and reminded me a lot of a San Francisco nightclub.
- The hotel had one of the craziest in-room shower contraptions I've ever seen.  There were four dials: The top one controlled water coming from above, the second one controlled water shooting at you directly from the panel perpendicular to the above water, the third dial controlled water from a handheld, and the bottom knob controlled temperature.  I had a lot of fun with this thing.
- They weren't stingy with soaps and towels and I got new stuff each night.
- Everything's really new.  I hope it stays this awesome a few years from now.
- There was a fun TV in hall to watch while waiting for the elevator.  Too bad it didn't have sound or closed captions.
- They were great about calling taxis, which were all charged to your room (no tip required even).
- Very friendly reception desk.  They greeted me in a friendly manner every time I passed through the area, gave restaurant/bar recommendations, and we got free local chocolate when we checked in.
- Great bar area.  It was almost always deserted, but the bartender was friendly, and the drinks were unique and good.  The seating was comfy.
- We put on a company event in the restaurant downstairs.  The food was really good for a hotel... skewers, ahi on crackers.

THE LESS GOOD:
- I found the decor very industrial.  It was like living in a hip nightclub rather than at home, which isn't really what I'm looking for in a hotel.
- It was a bit cold in general in the room.  As an Asian person who likes to walk around barefoot, it wasn't fun walking on cold concrete.  Turning on the heat helped, but then the air got really dry.
- The bathroom isn't fully enclosed so there's a large gap above bathroom conected to the bedroom.  This is well above eye level and helps air out the bathroom, but it means (1) you better trust the person in the bedroom isn't going to peek while you're taking a shower and (2) it's very hard for one person to get up earlier than the other person and take a shower, since everyone in the entire room can hear it.",HotelRED,1501 Monroe St,53711,4.0,"{'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False'}","Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel"

765,3,3,"I stayed here for a long weekend with my girlfriend back in late September.

As it has been a month since then, I'll stick with the essentials:

Pros: 

* AWESOME shower. directional jets all up and down the shower unit on the wall, hand wand, rain shower from above, 

* The big bed was amazingly comfortable, with quality sheets and pillows to match.

* Bath robes were not the usual rough terry towelling types, instead they were $125rrp luxury bath robes from a place in California, that I plan on buying as soon as I find the photo with the name!

*The fridge was a good size, with ample room for self-purchased food to be stored.

*A dishwasher! Great for longer stays. Power was included in the cabinet.

*Wine glasses, and full cutlery in the cupboards.

Cons: 

* The towels had an insanely strong chlorine smell. Requesting fresh towels, and the towels provided the next day also had this stong smell, which made you smell of chlorine after drying yourself off.

* After checking in at around 9am, housekeeping barged in at 9:45 without knocking and without announcing their visit, to check the minibar. This was most alarming and offputting.

* The hotel wifi was extremely slow for the duration of our stay. It also requires a logon, which prevents easy use of an AppleTV - which a lot of roadwarriors carry - I know it can be used with some ninja-tekneeq trickery, but who wants to be fiddling around getting it to work when you really want to relax!

We arrived here at 11:30pm and was able to find a parking spot in their underground parking garage that's attached to the hotel itself.  

Nice.  

Once we got out of the car all we had to do was go through the door and take the elevator up two floors before we were deposited in the hotel lobby.  Went up to the front desk attendendant.   He was very nice.  He welcomed us to Madison, asked us how many room keys we'd like - two please - showed us what elevators to take to get to our room and wished us a very nice stay.

The room itself was decent.  Clean and comfortable, a good two steps above what I was expecting to be honest. Complimentary coffee, shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, and soap, which I took home with me.  

Thank you very much.

All in all, a very comfortable hotel in the heart of downtown Madison.  We enjoyed our stay and loved the fact that we could park our car and walk everywhere.  

Also, the parking fees were only $7 a night and charged to our bill via the room key.  To check out all we had to do was swipe our key in the key reader upon exiting the parking garage and we were good to go.

The coolest thing about the room is that it was designed to be super eco friendly.  For instance, in order to turn the lights on, you have to slide your key card in the slot before they come on.  My only criticism that prevented me from giving it the elusive extra star was that my shower seriously had not been cleaned.  There was long hair everywhere, and it surly wasn't mine since I have little left!  However, I'm going to assume that this was an isolated incident.

However I hate the pillows, which are so thick that I wake with a crick in my neck and I got really sick because the air is so darn dry in the room that I woke with my throat did that thing where when you swallow it sticks together and then rips apart, leaving you with a sore throat for the rest of the day.  Only this time I had a long day of work ahead and the throat just got worse and worse.  It was raining outside for goodness sake.  It shouldn't be that dry inside.
Also, no room service.  
They don't allow employees to keep tips, which is just cruel.  All tips have to be given to a fund which goes to holding a party for the student employees (most of the housekeepers, etc.  are not students, but have to donate their tips to the student party fund).  I only know this because I didn't have cash and asked if I could put a tip for housekeeping on my credit card.  The middle -aged gentleman at the desk explained the tip situation to me.  

The air quality in the room is what really brings my rating of the hotel down.  It was so uncomfortably dry, even though I turned off the climate control and fan.

Lastly, though I appreciate the convenience of having a keurig in the room, I don't think I am alone in wanting real cream or milk for my coffee (especially when it is low quality coffee).  Not offering coffee in the lobby or anywhere in the hotel outside of the keurig in the room) for guests means that there is not milk or cream.  I cannot stomach the little packet of gross powdered non-dairy creamer; that stuff is un-drinkable.

1. The milk in the coffee machine at the Club Lounge was spoiled. This is just unacceptable. All of us used it until someone realized it was spoiled. That person was drinking the milk only. When added to coffee, it was not easy to detect the spoiled milk.
 
2. The very same machine did not function most of the days. It was being maintained, cleaned, unplugged or just plain broken.
 
3. In the middle of the breakfast, the staff decided to clean the machine, which made it unusable for 1 hour.
 
4. The staff stated vacuuming the floors (using a very loud vacuum cleaner) at the Club Lounge during our breakfast; one hour before the breakfast time was over (10:20 am on Saturday). Nobody was not able to talk due to high noise.
 
5. The computer/printer at the Club Lounge did not function for two days. We reported the issue to Tony several times. A technician came at one point and we were told that it was fixed. We tried it and realized that it was still broken. Next morning I called Toni and asked if the printer was working. Without hesitation he assured us that all the equipment at the Club Lounge was working. When we went to use the computer/printer, to our surprise, nothing was working. It is frustrating that Tony told us what we wanted to hear instead of confirming it before sending us there. 
 

6. The room keys did not work one day. Toni told us that it was a known problem and that the hotel was experiencing some technical issues. Our question is: if it is known by the management, why the issues has not beed addressed? Why inconvenience guests with broken key system?
 
7. The man's shower at the pool has only cold water (at least for the first 5 minutes I used).
 
8. One light bulb at the dining room in 803 is out. More attention to details is needed.
 
9. The window is covered with bird crap (803). It looks like it is old bird crap. Why not clean once a week?

I'd say the best part of this hotel is the location. It's right off the highway and very close to downtown but not close enough that the area is quite. They do offer a shuttle that goes to various destinations nearby. 

The lobby is very modern looking and there is even a small Starbucks shop, though the menu and hours are very limited to just the morning. The floors and the rooms are very elegant and are exactly what you expect to get from a Sheraton hotel.

Sadly, the walls are very thin. People talking or even the TV turned on to regular volume can be heard. Based on what others have said, this problem is found throughout the hotel.

They also changed our reservation from a king to 2 queens. 

I would have given this hotel a 5 stars (which is something because I don't give 5 stars lightly), but the housekeeping was a little off.  The staff immediately exchanged our room.

However, when we left, I realized I had left something in the first room and when my son asked the housekeeper, she had picked them up and they were on her cart. I was ever so grateful to get them back!

My only other minor disappointment was that there was not a refrigerator or microwave in our room, which I would have needed for a longer stay, but for an overnighter, it was perfectly fine.

- Comfortable beds

- Some of the front desk staff is downright rude. Most of them are good but I found some to be rather abrupt and unwelcoming.

799,1,2,"Wow, what an awful hotel experience. I've stayed in many a hotel, but this was by far the worst experience I've ever had.  First off, I get to the room and notice that the room is very small.  This is not to be expected from a room that costs $300 for the evening.  It's tiny.  The ""king"" sized bed couldn't have been King-sized because I'm 6'3"" and my feet were dangling off the end of the bed.  When most three-star hotels have a larger-screen tv than this hotel, you know something is wrong.  Also, because the tv was wall-mounted, I couldn't plug in my laptop and utilize all the movies I'd brought because you can't get to the HDMI input in the back of the tv as it is blocked by the wall mount.  At Hyatt Place hotels, for example, they have inputs right next to the desk for easy use.

I attended the ""free"" governor's club reception which was supposed to contain free cocktails and appetizers.  The appetizers consisted of quiche (blech) and raw vegetables.  Period.  The free cocktails consisted of a single bartender (backing himself) waiting on over 100 people.  I sat leaning over the bar for over 20 minutes and was never served a drink.  I got tired of waiting and left.  So much for ""free"" drinks.

The room was supposed to have a whirlpool tub.  It was the only reason I got the room.  The website shows pictures of an in-room jacuzzi type tub.  However, when I got to the room, the ""tub"" was just the bathroom tub.  Now, this may not matter to most people, but to me, it's extremely disappointing.  What if someone has to go to the bathroom while you're both soaking in the tub?  The other person has to get out, dry off, exit the room and then come back in to a room smelling like bowel movement.  Gross! It makes a huge difference where a jacuzzi type tub is located and I feel like they lied to me.

We ran into another couple on the elevator ride down who told us that they were eating at the hotel restaurant.  We ran into them on the way back from the dinner we ate in town and they had gotten food poisoning at the hotel's restaurant, ""Dayton street grille.""  Instead of giving them their $185 meal for free as they spent the night vomiting it all up, the hotel staff instead gave them 2 ""complimentary"" bottles of pepto bismol.  Wow.

Finally, the screen outside the window you can't open was loose and all night long made a very loud rattling noise.  If you don't think there isn't a lot of wind on the 14th floor of this hotel, then you are very much mistaken.  I couldn't get to sleep at all.

800,4,0,"Stayed here again last week, this time for three nights. No shuttle or valet, which we were not expecting, so no big deal. They also said they were out of the dog goodie bags but they did have plenty of dog treats in the lobby. The rooms are super quiet, which is a plus. We did have trouble with the water temperature in the shower but they literally sent a building engineer right up to our room, on Thanksgiving Day, to fix it within less than five minutes! So that was impressive. Just a couple small complaints this time: 1) They didn't restock the fridge in your room, even though we left a note asking for more water and a tip for the day. Both the note and the tip were left untouched, even though the room had obviously been cleaned. We had to go out and buy what we needed. 2) The bar doesn't open until 4 p.m., even on the Friday after Thanksgiving. I think that's a mistake, especially on a holiday weekend. My mom and I sat at the bar, and after several minutes, someone from the kitchen came out to tell us that he couldn't serve us anything but water or soda and that the bartender would not be there until 4 p.m. We left and went elsewhere and they lost $100+ because there were going to be four of us and we would have eaten, too.

While I fully understand that they were busy, I felt this was extremely unprofessional. When we finally got someone to get us drinks it took him approximately 4 minutes to pour two glasses of wine! He was clearly untrained and had no idea what he was doing. He struggled to open the wine bottle.  We also ordered a bloody mary, as they looked amazing.

We finally settled on one of them and also ordered a large-plate: the Fondue, which sounded like a great thing to share among the 3 of us. Perfect, right? It would have been, but... it ""wasn't available."" Huh?? If we hadn't already ordered and gotten our drinks, I would have walked at that point. To their credit, they did bring us a complimentary small plate assortment of meat/cheese roll-ups, which were delicious. Overall the vibe was ""not prepared to receive guests."" I'll have to be strongly persuaded to go back.

821,5,1,"Good place to come home to after a busy day

I was in Madison for Epic's 2016 UGM so I came in with the expectation that the front desk and hotel staff may be frazzled. To my surprise, this was not the case.

The hotel shuttle met us at the airport and the check in process was pretty straightforward without any hitches. The room was pretty spacious, well kept and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The room had a safe and the bathroom was not cramped at all.

Another bonus was the guest lounge on the 7th floor. This was where breakfast was served, but more importantly, during the evening, it was stocked with fresh fruit, cheese and cold cuts and a varierty of finger foods. Tish, the pleasant, friendly and courteous lady who was in charge of the lounge, made sure that all the guests were satisfied. The bottled water was free, but beer and wine was available at bar price. And to top the night off, Tish always laid a plate of cookies out for the guests. 

For the more adventurous, the front desk scheduled shuttle trips to downtown Madison every 30 minutes. And when you were ready to head back to the hotel, the shuttle was just a call away.

The next day our room was not cleaned when we returned at 2pm, but we called the front desk and it was cleaned quickly.  This time the maid only left 1 bottle of each shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and etc.  I have long hair and we had 3 people in our room, the maids need to leave more shampoos.

830,4,3,"Stayed at the Union Hotel for a weekend wedding. Being in our 30s we definitely felt a little old staying on a college campus, but the location was perfect since the wedding was at the Memorial Union. They have parking under the building (free for hotel guests), which was great but definitely hard to navigate in anything bigger than a Smart Car. The rooms were beautifully decorated and you can tell the place is brand new. Beds definitely comfy, nice big TVs. My only big gripe was the shower--obviously they are trying to conserve but the showerhead is about 7.5 feet up on the wall and pretty low-flow, meaning you barely get any water pressure by the time it hits you, and there is no door to the shower (just a ledge on the half closest to the showerhead), so there was usually a decent amount of water on the floor once you get out of the bathroom. There's also no lower ledge/shelf to help us ladies with the shaving. Considering their obvious effort to be ""Green"" (you have to keep your room key in the light switch to use electricity in the room, which really wasn't a big inconvenience and I thought a good idea), I was shocked that they replaced all the towels in my room after one day--even the ones we hung up and didn't leave on the floor (in my mind, indicating we were re-using). 

The people who work here were fantastically friendly, and you can't beat having all the conveniences of the Union right downstairs, including a bar with a bowling alley, plenty of food/coffee choices and a convenience store.

Kim Perez is their Director of Events, and is fabulous! I didn't have a wedding planner, but it felt like I did whenever she was around. I'd have all these details and lists of to-dos swimming around my head, but whenever I met with her my mind was calm. You can tell that she's been doing this for almost 20 years! I met with her several times in person before the wedding, she was available by email, and she was even there on the night of the wedding, until midnight! We had the reception room until midnight and the lobby bar was still open for the night-owl guests.

They have event packages for discounts on food/beverages, and plenty of their own decorations that are available. This made clean-up after the wedding go much smoother because I didn't have to supply centerpieces, linens, lighting... even cake cutting tools.

The hotel has more of an older, fancier look inside than the newer Holiday Inns, so it was perfect for a formal event. They have the Benevento's restaurant attached that catered the wedding. There's a splash pad for the kiddos, and special rooms with bunkbeds for the families that attended our wedding. All our guests were impressed and had a great time!

Did I mention our Suite? Huge! It overlooks the pool with a private balcony, has a hot tub, 2 TVs, couches, and huge beds. My husband and I had the best first night of sleep as a married couple.

853,5,0,"Decided to stay here after an unpleasant night at another hotel 6 miles NE of here. Talk about relief!!! The hotel was located very centrally to downtown- close to shops, restaurants, the lakes and (of course), the Capital. I felt ""grand"" from the moment I walked in, to the moment I checked out. 

THE DOUBLE QUEEN STANDARD ROOM: Extremely clean... Thank goodness. Sheets were clean, bathroom was spotless and desks outside of the restroom also seemed to be wiped down. Like any hotel, the carpet had normal wears and tears, but it didn't feel dirty. Walls were thick - didn't hear anything throughout the night. Beds weren't anything special, but the overall feel of the room was luxurious. This was a huge plus after coming from the last hotel. My only complaints would be housekeeping tapping on the door around 8:00am, and the WiFi dropping every few minutes. Nothing was uncomfortable enough to not have me come back. 

THE FOOD: Only had dessert here! Delicious as expected, didn't seem too overpriced. People who ordered food at the restaurant seemed happy with their meals. I would only ask the hotel to add chocolate cake to their dessert menu for the next time I come here! :) 

OTHER GUESTS: Very kind! Everyone seemed to enjoy each other's presence, no tension between the crowd. 

THE SERVICE: There's nothing good or bad I can say about the service provided. People working at the front desks did their jobs quickly and efficiently, other employees were kind enough to wave hello and ask how I was doing.

Last time being a week ago we have never heard back from them. long story short , our wonderful secretary showed up at noon to check in but the snob at the desk told her she needed a credit card. our secretary told her she had to run across town to get it from her husband which she did. When she returned the snob at the death said we need your husband's ID in order to use that. Our secretary was very upset and with her kids in tow had to run back across town to get the ID.

Why stay at The Concourse? Well, it's location is pretty great...a stone's throw away from the capitol building, near plenty of restaurants, shops and the Farmer's Market when it's in season! It's also just a trot away from State Street. Regardless, the location is prime as you're close to plenty of city life yet far enough away from the dorms. 

The rates are usually in the $200-$250 range when it's football season. This includes two queen beds, a TV, desk, mini fridge for your curds, etc. The bathrooms are in definite need of some love, as everything from the shower to the tile looks pretty sad. Kudos to providing Bath & Body works products, though! 

A couple more bright spots - the staff is extraordinarily sweet, there's a free shuttle to and from the airport, there's also a free shuttle during the day and evenings! No need to trek through the crowds or the snow!

875,5,0,"Beautiful. Dinner and accommodations were spectacular. Generally while I enjoy travel and all that comes with it, I don't care for sleeping away from home, at least the first night in any place. The second night or beyond, I'm relaxed and can sleep. 
This weekend, in part due to having the carpets cleaned, and being (August 25) our 20th anniversary we decided to go all out. 
This hotel offers what I wish everyone did: The Governors Club. The 11, 12, and 13th floors are exclusive meaning a penthouse bar with everything comped. 
The meal downstairs at the Circe restaurant offers some very beautiful selections. 
My Hanger steak as offered would've no doubt been hands down better than the way it was served. I unfortunately wanted the wild mushrooms and potatoes offered on another dish, the waitress was sweet and assured me the chef could alter to please guests. What I failed to realize in advance was something I knew better but forgot. When designing a special plate, the colors and arrangements are as important as the meal. 
So when my steak arrived smothered in lovely wild mushrooms, surrounded by delicious fingerling potatoes it all simply looked unappealing. While my wife's scallops meal was a rainbow by contrast. Mine was a study of non contrasting browns atop one another. 
It actually took till the third bite before I recognized the degree of my error. The first two bites were shiitake and another mushroom, though on first taste I mistook them for overdone slices of the steak. 
All in all, my meal was spectacular. The steak was cooked to the perfect rareness I asked for, seasoned as this type steak is best prepared. I have to stress,  it was ugly because I requested a bad idea. 
Kristin's scallops were nestled atop a purée of cauliflower and corn, with some delicious flavors strewn throughout each additional colorful bite. 

The desert selection was again, a wide variety of flavors and textures woven into vibrant colors, sweetness, salty and carefully placed bitters to contrast and please. All I can say with certainty is that I can't remember ever enjoying a brownie as much ever before. 

The entire experience was so far beyond what I'd anticipated that I'm writing this about a local hotel. I write much about eateries but never thought about doing the same for a hotel. I seriously doubt I'll ever enjoy another hotel as much as I just experienced.

877,3,2,"An impromptu weekend trip to Madison found me needing a room on short notice last October. After looking at the various booking sites, this Holiday Inn was the highest-rated hotel for the best deal. And I had a nice time, but there definitely were some hits and misses.

HITS:
- The ""King Leisure"" room was spacious and shaped kind of like a 90's-era telephone - a large sofa in the earpiece and big comfortable bed in the speaking piece. The bathroom was a trapezoidal offshoot off the ""handle"". The mattress was comfortable and everything was fresh and clean. The room even had a full-size mirror so we could take a full look at ourselves while getting ready for dinner.

- The hotel was hosting a big wedding, but we had no noise issues at all. Like, usually you can hear SOME noise in the hallways from normal guests. We heard nothing at all, and the hotel parking lot was packed. So kudos to the soundproofing in this one.

MISSES:
- The pillows on the bed weren't my favorite - they were too soft. There's a difference between soft, fluffy pillows and that kind of soft that sinks down and eventually just flattens completely. These pillows were the latter kind.

- Our mini fridge was on the small side, so we didn't have as much room as we thought we might for our leftovers from the Farmer's Market. We made it work, but it took advantage of our Tetris skills.

- The rooms could do with a remodel eventually. There was a good amount of lighting, but the light bulbs, shades, and wallpaper combined to make a yellowish cast, which I dislike. The yellow light plus the dark carpeting and furniture ended up making the room look smaller than it was, which is a shame. 

- I was shocked to discover that the breakfast at this hotel was not free. I called to determine what the offerings were, and was told that it's your typical breakfast buffet offerings - scrambled eggs, breakfast meats, Belgian waffles, toast, cereal, that kind of thing. When you're paying $150 after taxes for a room and you're expected to pay extra for access to breakfast, that breakfast better be something more than you can eat for free at the Baymont Inn down the road. It just feels like you've bought the ""free"" version of an app, but you know you're not getting the full app experience unless you fork over $4.99 of your hard-earned cash to iTunes. Technology rant aside, I opted to drive a minute away to the Barriques and get myself some breakfast goodies and coffee.

Now, let's be clear: I love Madison. I love that city with all my heart and would sleep in little more than a shoebox just so I can eat hot and spicy cheese bread and take pretty pictures of lakes. But anyone who has spent any significant amount of time in Madison knows that the city has a hotel problem. If you want to stay where the action is - that is, downtown - you're paying through the nose for the privilege. This Holiday Inn does a nice job of saving you some money and getting you away from any noise problems you may find. But I would eventually like to see the furnishings get updated and have the breakfast opened up to all guests - for a hotel regularly charging more than $120 for a room before taxes, guests nowadays expect no less.",Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Madison West,1109 Fourier Dr,53717,3.0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'}","Venues & Event Spaces, Resorts, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services"

The front desk staff is usually gone when you need them and useless when they are there. The Staff cannot resolve anything for you. They have room service from the Italian restaurant  which is attached and it is a BAD NEWS food. I tried about five items in the menu and gave up.

If your travels are taking you to the Alliant Energy Center, this is where you need to stay.

Really great SPG love from very charming staff.  I was checked in quickly and seamlessly, and when asked what I wanted for my Platinum amenity, I asked (as I usually do) what their ""local amenity"" was.  Now - most hotels just shrug and say ""a free movie and 2 beers"" or a baseball cap.  The Sheraton Madison has beat every other Starwood hotel in my book by answering ""a sausage and cheese platter.""  Ding Ding Ding - yes please!  The FD agent even offered to have a fridge installed into my room to keep the platter at a safe temperature while I popped back out after checking in to go to my meeting.  

Going upstairs to drop off my gear (not 10 minutes after checking in), I already found the hotel's maintenance personnel in my room installing the fridge.  5 minutes after he left, the young lady from F&B was up with the massive platter piled high with delightful salty treats.  The room I was received was upgraded to the Club floor, and even though it was right by the elevators and across from the Club Lounge, it was very quiet.  Nothing huge or spectacular, but I wasn't really looking for much during a 1-night stay.  The lounge was well-stocked with all the basics of water, juices, fresh fruit, and both the breakfast and afternoon happy hour had plentiful, fresh, hot food.  

While this hotel isn't in downtown Madison, I think with the advantages of being just off a highway, right by the conference/concert center, surrounded by plentiful parking, and with a staff eager to please, it's a winner.

Someone finally came after about 15-20 minutes. Our room was outdated, dirty, stained towels, and ice cream left spilt in the fridge from a previous guest. We've stayed for 4 nights and 2 of those nights we came back to the hotel tired and carrying a lot of items and were locked out of our hotel room and had to call to get into the room. We did not store the key card near our phones so it should not have been an issue, but it was. 2 of the 4 mournings housekeeping came into the room at or before 9am while we were sleeping. If they knocked it definitely wasn't loud enough and they walked in at least one to me not fully dressed which was a total invasion of privacy. Additionally, management was horribly rude. We went to dinner and were wanting to check out the ""water park pool"" feature at the hotel after dinner so we checked on closing time on our way out to dinner and it said 12 which we though was late, but we figured because the pool was a special feature, it may be open later. We had misread the sign thinking it closed at midnight when it actually closed at noon. Without realizing our mistake, we went to the pool, which was unlocked, after dinner around 10 and sat chatting in the spa quietly. The manager came in and aggressively yelled at us. I apologized and said, ""I must have misread the sign. We will head out."" And he yelled at  us more. My husband asked for his name and he wouldn't tell us.

UPDATE
____________________________________________________

I had to move rooms at 10 pm- I had 4 teenagers staying next door to me.  When asked why they placed a business traveler in a room next to kids without a chaperon- the front desk replied that they were not able to check that when I checked in.  I asked them when the kids arrived- and of course, it was the day before.  The front desk then replied that they could not always arrange things to ensure problems do not happen.  REALLY???  How about you try! Asking the kids to quiet down, or speaking with their chaperon did not seem to be an option.. just moving me.  How wonderful!  Just what I wanted to do!!!

What a load of crud!  If you are catering to working travelers, having them pack up their computers and clothes at 10 pm so that they can work in peace, and maybe, just maybe get some sleep is not acceptable.    The doorman who brought my *new* keys was polite and explained that they are not used to kids on a Monday night... GREAT..   YES, I am cranky about this.  I am not used to having hotels act this way.  Well, there is one thing I can do. I suppose that unless things go much better in the morning, they will not get used to me, or anyone from my organization staying here.  Seems like a fair trade.
 
ASIDE FROM THE POUNDING ON THE WALL as well as SCREAMING COMING THROUGH...

The front desk staff was courteous and helpful.  Parking was easy.  The hotel itself has seen better days, but has been updated.  You do have to take an elevator up from the parking garage to check in.

Rooms are so/so.  I am a frequent traveler, and am used to getting govt. or state rate at pretty nice places.  This room does not measure up to the Hilton or Marriott level, but is fine for one night.  The bathroom tub/shower stall needs some updating.  I suppose you could equate it with an older Sheraton.

Room service was speedy and yummy, had a decent selection.  The front desk was able to recommend a spa/ beauty salon that could fit me in for a pedicure tonight!  That was greatly appreciated.

908,2,1,"I would never stay here again, nor would I recommend this hotel.
Let's start with the bad, as it outweighs the good for me:  The credit card machine was not working when we arrived, so I had to hand write all my credit card information on a piece of paper and trust that they will securely shred it afterward.  
The furniture in our room was dirty (dust and stains) and there was even a six-inch tear in the side of the couch fabric that no one had even attempted to mend.  
The Keurig was broken; my friend had to hold the lid at the precise correct angle for it to work.  The ice machine was also broken.  
The cement floors were freezing and my friend forgot to bring socks, so we requested a pair of the complimentary slippers that they advertise in the room -- of course they were out.  
We ate in the restaurant for dinner, which is proclaimed to be fine dining, but had to wait 15 minutes before anyone offered us a drink, then another 15 minutes before we could order.  There were only 2 other tables at the time.  The food took forever to arrive and really was not worth the price (though my cocktail was tasty).  The waitstaff did not check on us even once.  We had to waive people down for every need (more water, a side plate, and the check). 
Several days after my stay, a random $9.50 charge appeared on my credit card.  When I called to inquire, they said it was for popcorn from the mini bar, which we did not eat.  We brought our own snacks.  The glass shower is not really conducive to sharing a room with someone who is not your spouse/significant other, as they will be unable to use the toilet/brush teeth/apply makeup etc. without seeing the other person naked. 
The parking area is super tight and not very secure feeling. 

The good...I can't say any one thing was really impressive.  The bed was comfortable enough, though I hated the pillows.  The wi-fi worked well in our room.  The balcony was large and would have been nice in the summer (we didn't try it in 12 degree weather), but I could see paperclips and other debris out there.  The TV was a good size and could be angled to watch from the seating area or the bed.  The front desk staff was polite and friendly.

910,1,0,"Unpleasant stay. My husband and I are staying here as part of vacation in an executive suite. We arrived late and exhausted from our flight at about 1am and no one was as the desk. Someone finally came after about 15-20 minutes. Our room was outdated, dirty, stained towels, and ice cream left spilt in the fridge from a previous guest. We've stayed for 4 nights and 2 of those nights we came back to the hotel tired and carrying a lot of items and were locked out of our hotel room and had to call to get into the room. We did not store the key card near our phones so it should not have been an issue, but it was. 2 of the 4 mournings housekeeping came into the room at or before 9am while we were sleeping. If they knocked it definitely wasn't loud enough and they walked in at least one to me not fully dressed which was a total invasion of privacy. Additionally, management was horribly rude. We went to dinner and were wanting to check out the ""water park pool"" feature at the hotel after dinner so we checked on closing time on our way out to dinner and it said 12 which we though was late, but we figured because the pool was a special feature, it may be open later. We had misread the sign thinking it closed at midnight when it actually closed at noon. Without realizing our mistake, we went to the pool, which was unlocked, after dinner around 10 and sat chatting in the spa quietly. The manager came in and aggressively yelled at us. I apologized and said, ""I must have misread the sign. We will head out."" And he yelled at  us more. My husband asked for his name and he wouldn't tell us. I showed him the sign and explained the confusion and he said ""too late young lady."" which is incredibly sexist and offensive to say to an adult woman.

913,5,4,"Color me (red) impressed! HotelRed is pretty fab! In terms of accessible and affordable hotels (outside of game days), this modern abode is tops. Let's roll down the attributes, shall we? 

The location: A stone's throw away from Camp Randall and very accessible to campus. If you need to throw yourself into anything Bucky related, this is a great location.  

The lobby: Clean, modern and full of red accents! I felt quite welcomed in this well lit space filed with friendly employees. 

The service: Speaking of friendly, everyone I encountered from the front desk attendant to housekeeping to the concierge to the CM was quite cool. Not overly smiley-in-your-face-so-cheery-it-hurts, but perfectly amiable. 

The rooms: Full kitchenettes in every room! Woot! And a nicely price honor bar to boot. The beds are quite soft and comfy with a nice view of the large LG flatscreen. The bathrooms are also very modern with a giant showerhead and sprayers. And don't forget the Aveda bath products. Don't think I didn't take those home. My one recommendation - provide each room with a pair or two of slippers or grippy socks - those concrete floors can be chilly on bare feet! 

The restaurant: I ordered room service from The Wise, the restaurant downstairs. My baked mac and cheese with artichokes and pancetta was pretty delightful. If you get a chance to snack or sip at the hotel, definitely give the restaurant a go. Plus, their patio is comfortable and huge! 

The amenities: Free parking, access to a few nearby fitness opportunities (health clubs, bike rentals, running trails), and complimentary chocolates and beverage upon arrival.",HotelRED,1501 Monroe St,53711,4.0,"{'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False'}","Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel"
914,2,3,"Overall, we found the Concourse Hotel to be overrated. The photos online, particularly of the jacuzzi rooms, are wildly misleading. Be aware this is absolutely a bathtub with jets. And while it is a good sized tub, it is in the bathroom. There are no views of the beautiful night skyline from your ""hot tub"". There is no conversing with other guests while you're soaking. You will be in the bathroom looking only at the toilet and the hairs left behind from previous users . The tub had a self cleaning feature, so I don't think housekeeping does any real scrubbing of these tubs. There were multiple strands of hair in the tub, requiring me to scrub it down myself in order for us to use it. Also, the tub is loud so if you want to enjoy while anyone else sleeps, it's difficult to do. 

The rest of the room is relatively small. There was a view of the capitol, however you had to stand directly in front of the window to see it. The drapes and curtains only seemed to slide to one direction; however they were removed from a majority of the hooks so I don't believe they were functioning accordingly. For fear of making them worse, we didn't attempt to tinker with them. 

There is no refrigerator or microwave, no bottles of water, etc. in the room. There is an ice bucket with instructions for who to call, should you want ice, but there is no ice machine on the floor. I woke up at 3:30am one night and called the desk to ask whether there was a vending machine or soda machine where I could purchase a bottle of water and the receptionist replied that she believed there were vending machines on the 3rd-8th floor, but couldn't confirm. We were staying on the 14th floor and needless to say, I didn't feel like wandering braless to numerous floors in search of a bottle of water, in the middle of the night. I ended up cupping my hands and drinking from the bathroom faucet. 


The governors lounge is a nice concept, but space is very limited. Many times, due to the crowd, you are forced to stand around the perimeter of the room to drink/eat. As a result, we were in and out and didn't enjoy this ""perk"" as much as we had hoped. Definitely do not plan to use this as a substitute for buying food/drinks elsewhere. 

The location of the hotel makes for lots of noise and interrupted sleep. Between public transportation, early morning garbage/recycling pick ups, wedding receptions at the hotel and typical weekend shenanigans on the square, we didn't sleep soundly during our stay. The overly soft bed and flimsy pillows didn't help either. 

I have never written a review like this before and now feel bad for not writing good reviews for some of the beautiful places I've stayed in Madison. The Concourse Hotel may be suitable for some. There seemed to be many guests over 65 enjoying themselves. We are in our 30's (doctor and nurse) and truly don't have unreasonable expectations. We have stayed at other hotels at this same price point and found them to offer a more pleasant overall experience. If you're looking for a convenient location with a beautiful view, quiet surrounding environment, attentive staff and rooms with better amenities, go to the Edgewater!

 This time, things were much, much, much improved. I checked in and was the guest of the day... coo-incidence?  Don't think so, but, I will TAKE it!

What is guest of the day?  Free upgrade to the governor's club- the exclusive level.  Rooms are bigger, have better views, are on secured floors, and have access to the Governor's club itself. 

Soo, what does that mean?  FREE BOOZE!!  From 4:30-9 if you are staying on one of these 3 floors, you have access to a full tended bar and FREE BOOZE!  NO LIMITS!  There are also FREE apps to keep something in your tummy, and FREE DESSERTS from 9-10.  

Hellooooo, why did I not know of this before?  If I would have taken advantage of this last time, i doubt that the room full of screaming teens would have registered on me, I would have been sleeping soundly. FREE BOOZE!! *SMILES*

You also have traveler amenities like a computer, printer, and fax, as well as a Free breakfast.

The rates are about 30 more than normal, however, I can easily drink 30$ worth of Booze... and having the opportunity for FREE diet cokes (my crack) easily makes up for everything.  I do have to admit, at the risk of my reputation, that I could not enjoy the FREE BOOZE this trip. My stomach is still crunchy from the flu, however, I HAVE PLANS.  BIG PLANS!

The dirty plates and glasses were quickly growing on our table though. I did not see anyone clearing plates as people were finishing with their food/drinks. I opted for the vegetarian meal for the lunch and it was gnocchi with a (stroganoff sauce?) on top. This was WAY too rich of a meal during a conference. I was only able to eat half my meal because it was so rich and filling. I almost fell asleep during the next session after lunch! The custard with fruit glaze for dessert was really good though. I should have saved a bit more room for more of it though. They served tea, water and coffee with the lunch. The chicken meal served to others looked to be dry chicken with a side of mushy veggie medley. I asked someone else how their meal was and was told basically the same thing.

920,3,0,"After visiting Madison numerous times, we finally got a chance to stay and HotelRED.  Overall, it was a mixed experience.  The room was nice and not your typical hotel room.  The balcony was spacious and, with the beautiful weather, nice feature.  The design of the room lends itself to the occupants being on the same schedule as the light and noise from the bathroom come directly into the sleeping area. 

There's a nice workout facility on the main floor with a good variety of cardio, free weights, and a cable system.  I only got to use it once though as during the second visit a hotel guest brought his 2 year son with him.  The son had a terrible cold with running nose and all that comes with it.  After I saw the son touching everything after using his hands on his runny nose, I decided I would work out elsewhere.  (Obviously not the hotel's fault except maybe the could put a minimum age requirement on the fitness center)

My biggest beef was with the lack of parking.  Yes, the website indicates parking is on a first come first serve basis but isn't that true almost every place????? What it should say is that there is very limited onsite parking.  And, the hotel staff is not very helpful with providing insights on additional parking options.  We arrived back at the hotel around midnight one night.  All the hotel parking was taken so I asked a front desk clerk for options -- could I park in the church lot directly behind the hotel???? Other nearby parking garages????  Parking on the street????  The responses I got:  ""You can park behind the shuttle bus as we aren't using it anymore this evening.""  But, the clerk couldn't tell me when they would need it in the morning so I didn't know by when I'd need to move my car.  The clerk couldn't recommend any nearby parking garages:  ""The only ones I know of are at least 10 minutes away.""  Why couldn't the hotel couldn't have a nice pre-printed sheet with some nearby parking options on it???

There is a nice restaurant on the roof, however unfortunately you can't charge to your room. The one downside is no room service. But again, you can walk to whatever you may need so it was fine!

Also, the door was so heavy, that it required super strength to open.  There was literally no reason for this, as it didn't improve anything....all it did, was make it ridiculously hard to enter and exit our room.  

There was no soap bar or body wash in the bathroom, to use in the shower.  There was one little bar, which we used to wash our hands instead.  We decided to forego showering and just leave early, to go home and shower.  The walls were literally paper thin.

We started our afternoon with the Skyview Lounge to watch the sunset over the capitol. Right when we walked in we were amazed at how beautiful the entire hotel is and the 10th floor views of the Skyview Lounge are breathtaking. We sat at the bar and tried to order Bloody Marys. Our bartender was how do I say, crabby. I don't think he wanted to be at work. He did wait on us promptly. Then he explained that they have Bloody Marys but the mix is pre-made if you like that sort of thing... Okay. I chose a sparkling rose and my husband had a delicious cucumber gimlet. We took our drinks over to the window as all the seats were open. There was one other couple in the lounge at the same time, 4 p.m. after the sunset we wanted our check. The cocktail waitress was very involved in a 15-minute conversation with the only other customers in the lounge. This is by no means an exaggeration. We put our coats on thinking that would signal her that we are ready to leave. After 15 minutes of her back turned towards us we decided to go ask the bartender if we could just have our check. That turned into five more minutes of trying to explain to us what sounded like every excuse in the world without any action or apology. Apparently if you move to a table a bartender cannot give you your check is what we were told standing now for 15 to 20 minutes with our coats on trying to pay our check because we were late for another reservation, we were told we need to ask our server. Who was literally 2 feet behind us still talking with the other couple about her life plans and her skill sets and her future aspirations Etc. I told the bartender can you see she's very busy? And I was replied with she's the only one who can give you your check. At a certain point you have to laugh. How can it be so difficult to give you our money? May I tell you what we ordered? We each had one drink. Buy the 20 minute mark a bartender produced our bill, we paid and got out of there finally. I'm so sorry that this beautiful place is run by very unprofessional sophomoric service.

Walked in late afternoon, greeted at the front desk. Quick and polite.

Got to the elevator, took a second to figure out the card. Really nice to have the added security measures.

Get to the room, I had a two bed. Nice lighting throughout the room. Nice view of the capitol building and downtown Madison. 

Comfy beds. Nice little fridge w/ water and glass cups. Plenty of storage space. Bathroom was nice, shower was awesome.

Bar was swanky, great views, very business casual feeling. Nice people up there. Good drinks. There is a little lounge/fireplace area. And an outdoor seating area that is pretty sweet looking, though it was late at night when I discovered it and wasn't able to go out there. 

Work out room was solid, plenty of weights and cardio equipment. 

No pool :( If there was a pool or 18+ hot tub (lets face it... kids always ruin the hot tub) I'd totally give 5 stars.

Outside area has a heated lamp area. The downstairs bar has a really awesome lightshow on the wall.

The room I booked was a view of the capitol; once I checked in I was giving a room that faced the opposite direction. I called to have this switched, they said they would call back - they didn't. I went to the front desk to follow up and received and explanation that the Skyline room I booked did not guarantee capitol views. They switched my room to one with the caption view anyway.

My second room was on the 9th floor, directly below the 10th floor Kitchen / Dinning room for Eno Vino. There were extremely loud noises coming from above for the first few hours of staying in my room. I called the front desk and they said they would ask them to quiet down. This did not help. The gym was shared a wall with my room so the music played in the gym could be clearly heard from my room. I had to go to the gym and turn the music off on multiple occasions as there was no one in the gym listening to the music. 

I was awoken at 5AM by more loud noises from above. This time tables and chairs being dragged across the floor for a solid 45 minutes. This included the random loud thud from whatever they were doing to set up breakfast. After that noise dissipated there were a few people running on the treadmill in the gym - every footstep can be heard in this room. 

Contenitnal breakfast (fruit, cheese, yogurt) is $15. Terrible.

As for our direct contact, our check-in guy, Calvin, told us about the hotel shuttle. We were lucky enough to find out for our parents who were coming later and we got to use it later on in our stay. Logan was the one who helped us book our shuttle to the airport and it worked out very well.

Casey also helped us with a late check-out which was amazing as we were there during Memorial Day weekend and were helping the happy couple with anything we could - also was nice to sleep in a bit after a long and fun holiday weekend.

The beds were comfortable and the room had a nice view of the Capitol. We did have some issues with the shower leaking, but the housekeeping staff was great with providing extra towels.

The lobby was nice and they had a bar and lounge section that also had complimentary coffee and cookies. In the evening, there were little baggie to make some lavender sacks to help with sleep. That was a cool touch.

They are also known for their rooftop bar and Bistro, Eno Vino. They have drinks, tapas type dishes and great views. Our Lyft driver also recommended to us so it was nice that it was so convenient to get to. Not the cheapest place to eat, but the food was good.

The hotel was also a 2 minute walk to the Capitol so we got to check that out (no charge) and on Saturday, we were lucky enough to experience the farmer's market in Capitol Square.

Overall my husband and I had a nice time, but a little disappointed for our bride/groom friends who had an issue with the additional room they booked and the gift bags not being properly distributed.",AC Hotel by Marriott Madison Downtown,One North Webster St,53703,3.5,"{'WiFi': ""'free'"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False'}","Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels"

969,1,0,"One year later, and the hotel is worse than before. When I arrived I was checked into a room 9' the second floor. There was construction equipment outside my ""High Floor Skyline View"" room - I paid an up-charge for the specific room, but was told there were no more available because they were overbooked. Coincidentally, the room type in their system also changed to reflect a different type of room. However, my email confirmation indicates the room I paid for. The manager was quite oblivious on how to respond to a bad situation, and should seriously not be running a hotel.

On Monday, I had the delightful experience of being woken up by construction working laughing and chatting directly outside my window as they got ready to start their shift, this was at 6AM. 

Unbelievable. I've filed a formal complaint with Marriott customer service, as this stay was so unbelievably terrible.

Here's the deal ... it's a Howard Johnson..not a Ritz Carlton. So I know going in that the hotel isn't going to blow me away. But - it was ok.

The room was clean, it was air-conditioned, and they have shampoo AND conditioner (I hate the combo bottles.. women can't brush their hair when they use that stuff!) 

I guess I was overly-excited because from the exterior this place looked pretty new. On the inside however it seems like it needs some work. I was staying on the second floor but you had to take the elevator to the third floor and walk down a flight of 6 stairs to get to the second floor. Weird! It reminded me of a half floor.. like in ""Being John Malkovich.""

Here's the plus side:
-There's a pool and a spa
-There is an arcade/billiards room
-There is a bar (but the bartender was literally on the phone the ENTIRE time. She actually just put the phone down to serve people and then picked it back up again to resume her convo. Really really shocking. This went on the entire 2 hours I was there.)

1005,1,6,"Where do I begin...

I walked in this hotel from a long flight from New York City for my cousin's wedding. Maribel, the check in girl, was clearly having a rough night. After notifying me that I only booked one room, after I told her I had two rooms and to check under other names, she informed me that I needed to call hotels.com. I had no problem doing that. She was clearly having a bad day and was interested in transferring her anger to someone else. 

First of all, the customer service was the worse I have ever experienced in my life. I have stayed in a favela in Brazil, a luxury hotel in Paris, a beach resort in Grand Cayman, on the waterfront in Capetown, South Africa and numerous domestic locations. And I have never felt so undervalued, humiliated, and disturbed as a customer. I felt targeted, since I checked in with a group of African Americans in a hotel that was shockingly white. I did not want to be serviced by the rude girl, Maribel so I asked to speak to Elizabeth. She informed me that she had to speak with other customers. I waited. After she started to help me, they completely ignored me, talking about me within earshot. I was floored. 

After asking to speak to a manager,  I was led to the security. The security told me that they were refusing my services and that I had to leave. I can not believe it. I have never in my life felt so discriminated, targeted, and offended. This was the worse experience. I had to scramble to find another hotel. They told me they refunded my money and they did not. I had to use the security guard as a proxy. This, while my parents were treated rudely, my sister was ignored after checking in, then they called the police on my two aunts, several female cousins and described my 1 male cousin as a perp. Completely out of hand. Another customer, who happened to be a white woman, had to come to our aide and explain to the officers what happened. Maribel left the hotel in a taxi while my family was still in the lobby. I left. 

It was completely uncalled for. It was so belligerent and violent of them to display that level of aggression towards customers. My family had already checked in and paid and they refused to talk to them. I didn't know if I was in 2015 America or 1915. I just have never had such a terrible experience. I would suggest that no one in their right mind stay at a hotel like this. 

This hotel is an absolute customer service nightmare. You will not only feel unwanted but you will see first hand the challenges that this hotel has failed to address.",Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel by Wyndham Madison,3841 E.Washington Ave,53704,2.0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'""}","Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel"
1006,3,0,"I travel a lot between work and personal stuff. We came across this location on Hotwire while on the road, deciding we needed to get some shut eye. As I sit in the hotel bar after driving 500 miles, with a 2-hour pit stop at Chicago's Navy Pier, this is my midnight review:

Hotel clerk: ""chill"" per my 17 year old. 5 stars.
Hotel condition: halls: 1 star. Overall, 2.5.
Bartender: 5. Awesome. He kept it open for a few of us. I paid $8 for a bottle of IPA and two Spotted Cow drafts ... wow. I feel guilty paying so little.
Bar: 3 stars. Darts and pool work. Old arcade machines do not. Clean, just not swank or cozy.
Hotel room: 3 stars. Way better than the gross hall, deteriorating condition of the larger building.

This is not the hotel chain I remember as a kid 40 years ago. What happened?  So why a 3 and not a 2?

1007,1,4,"I stay in this hotel regularly for military duty. Over the years I've heard reports of bed bugs being found in the rooms. I always check the corners of the mattress, but this was not enough. On June 5-6th, 2014 I woke up to bed bugs crawling all over my pillows. After switching rooms and still not feeling comfortable I was switched to a different (and much better hotel -- The EconoLodge, also on East Washington). Management was extremely insensitive as the female manager attempted to reassure me that they take the proper procedures to rid their hotel of bed bugs but never once apologized to me; she was more concerned with highlighting the hotel's procedures (which were NOT followed properly, obviously). Military PUBLIC HEALTH inspected the room and found the bed bugs infestation under the mattress. They confirmed the proper procedures were NOT followed and that no one had checked my room in 5-6 days and that if they had they would have seen the sure signs of bed bugs. The State Health Department was also notified. I had to go to the ER due to the allergic reaction from the bites. Since Friday I have found over 100 bites all over my body and I'm on steroids/other medications. In addition, I have had to all but quarantine all my belongings in order to not bring bed bugs into my home. Lastly, my car was broken into last year while parked at this hotel.

1009,1,0,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I don't even know where to start because it was all so terrible. 

Hmmm, where to begin: First off, there was no one behind the desk when we went to check in. After an obnoxious amount of time and me somewhat passive-aggressively tapping my fingers on the counter, a woman unapologetically walked out. She seemed to be the manager yet had no idea how to look us up, so the simple process of checking my husband and I in took around 10 minutes. Fine, not a huge deal, I'm not that petty, let's move on. 

The layout. I've gotten through fun houses drunk in the dark at State Fair more easily then I was able to navigate this place. It defies all logic the way it's set up and once you find your room, you may be reluctant to leave it lest you never find your way back. Except that you will want to leave it, immediately. Because it's filthy. The hallway smells like a lovely juxtaposition of baby puke, mildew, stale smoke, and fried food. The rooms smell like all of the aforementioned plus a healthy dose of gym socks. Our room looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since the place was built. Food crumbs right out in the open, and not tiny crumbs but entire things like fortune cookies, dog food and Cheetos. Everything was coated in layers of sticky dust. More food (human and dog) in the bedside table drawer. The edges of the entire room were coated with nastiness and had never seen the attachment of a vacuum. The curtains were covered in what looked like spaghetti sauce, chocolate milk, and boogers. Grout in bathroom was practically growing its own garden of mold. I've had better pillows at my gynecologist's office. Don't look under the bed skirt if you want to sleep ever again. I'd rather have discovered a clown under there than what I did happen across. Oh, and the air conditioning sent me into a vicious asthma attack, so that was fun. 
The key cards barely worked and it took several minutes to get in.  My 70-year old mom who was with us had to leave the door unlocked and slightly ajar whenever she went outside to smoke.  Anyone could have gotten into the room while she wasn't there and speaking of which, the side parking lot where the front desk woman told us to park at night is full of shady people, many of whom were also hanging out in the courtyard. The doors from the courtyard into the hotel are unlocked and do not require a key card, either, which means said shady people can roam the halls freely. And they were. 

Then there's the pool, which was the only reason we booked this place. I wanted to swim so badly, but the pool looked like something out of ""National Lampoon's Vacation"".  There isn't enough chlorine in the world to make that pool swimmable. It was also colder than Lake Michigan and probably much dirtier. 

Lastly, every ice and vending machine in the entire hotel was out of order.  I take that back, the soda machine in the lobby worked but was out of stock of pretty much everything except grape soda. But ice? Forget it. Every floor, the commons areas, nada. The out of order ice machines made a loud torturous beeping sound that could be heard from anywhere in the hotel, as if the machines themselves were crying out to be rescued from the endless doom of occupying the halls of such a disgusting dump. There also is no mini-fridge in the room just in case you were entertaining the preposterous notion of having any food or drinks at less than room temperature, although I suppose you could toss all your beers and waters into the pool to cool them down. 
For obvious reasons, we didn't even bother with the bathroom coffee maker for fear of what might be lurking in there and steered clear of the continental breakfast.  For what we paid, we could have gotten something halfway decent and dare I say, enjoyable.  Instead, we just wanted to dip ourselves in Lysol the second we left.

My son drove to the hotel (from Chicago) and no one could find the blanket. I called the next day to talk with a manager and he said he would look into the issue and call me back. He called back about 45 minutes later and said he reviewed the footage from the security camera and he can see a staff member using the blanket and then packing it up with the stuff she took home with her. He also said he was going to call her in and work this out so we could get our blanket back. I never heard from them again. I have called the hotel twice a week for 8 weeks now and no one will call me back about a refund for the blanket or the gas/tolls for the wasted trip.

1018,1,0,"This was a terrible hotel. We walked in and no one was at the desk, we waited for longer than deemed fair. The check in took longer than it needed to be as well, the person checking us in seemed distracted and was not focused on helping us. We went to our room and noticed the sink handle was having trouble, you had to push really hard up in it to start it and it only had 2 levels, off and jet which would hurt your hand. The toilet was also almost impossible to flush. The quilts on the beds had stains and rips and loose strings. The beds were also very small. We went to the pool and saw that it had no stairs only ladders to get into the pool which would not help at all with a toddler. The pool also looked all scratched up and just not good looking. The ""hot tub/whirlpool"" also did not look that nice. There was also a funky smell. Personally I would say if you have a family and plan on staying there with a family you should stay elsewhere, if it is just you and maybe one more person and you don't want to spend money and you just need to stay the night and leave in the morning then sure stay there.

1027,5,3,"I'm nearing the end of an 8-day stay. I'm an IHG Club Spire Elite & Inner Circle member, and I made my room reservation well in advance on the IHG website. I've stayed at many other Hotel Indigo properties, and also many other IHG properties, including Holiday Inn, Kimpton Hotel, Crowne Plaza, and the Palazzo in Vegas.

Here are some notes regarding my stay:

-- WiFi was excellent, and very fast.

-- My King suite (small suite) room on the 4th floor was excellent: very bright, airy, w/high ceilings, very clean, quite spacious, and well furnished.

-- The bathroom was spacious and extremely clean.

--All hallways and common spaces were wide, spotlessly clean and neat, spacious, and well-lighted.

-- My room was very quiet; I never heard any sounds from other rooms, the hallway, or the street.

-- Speaking of my quiet room, I must point out that the central HVAC system (heating, ventilation and air conditioning system) in my room was very quiet.

-- Lobby seating space, along with alternate seating spaces available in other areas, was very plush, comfortable and plentiful, much as the Hotel Indigo chain is famous for. Since I often have clients who schedule stays at the same hotel in order to meet w/me during my stay, and since I often meet w/them in lobby seating spaces, I discovered that the offerings in this hotel were more than sufficient in this regard.

-- All staffers that I encountered during my stay, including front desk staffers, managers, housekeepers, and restaurant staff, were quite helpful and attentive, and usually quite responsive.

-- There was a good-sized and spotlessly clean fridge in the room. and, best of all, it had all of its shelves.

-- There are two elevators for the 155 rooms in this 5-floor hotel. They are more than sufficient for a hotel of this size.

-- The lobby restaurant was a kinda trendy place called Pallette, and it was quite good. I ate many of my breakfasts and dinners there. Menu selection was good, food quality was very good and service was fine.

-- the only problems that I encountered during my stay emerged during my early check-in at ~12:45 PM. As an IHG Spire Elite member with the perk of a 10AM check-in, I often ask for early check-in (usually around noon to 1 PM) during my many stays at IHG hotels, and the vast majority of them are able to do this flawlessly.

In this case, I'd called 3 weeks earlier to ask for early check-in of about 12:30 PM. I'd been traveling for over 7 hours when I arrived in the lobby, and, once there, I saw, at the only open station, a long line. When I asked where I could find the dedicated check-in line for IHG Club Elite members could be found, a front desk manager explained to me that there was none; as a new hotel, they're allowed up to 12 months to set up a dedicated Elite check-in station with signage.

Thus, I was forced to wait in the seemingly long line at the sole open station. Luckily, over the next 3 minutes, most of the folks on the line left the lobby w/out approaching the desk. When I got to the desk, I was told by a male clerk that my Spire Elite upgrade room wouldn't be ready for at least 45 minutes. He asked me to take a seat in the lobby to wait  45 to 60 minutes until he could bring my room keys to me. At this point, I got annoyed, because I have, as a Spire Elite member, NEVER been asked at any IHG hotel to sit and wait for my room to be readied during an early check-in, and so I asked to speak with a manager.

In short order, the very friendly and competent Operations Manager, Zach, arrived. He offered me the use of a temporary room, aka a Complimentary Room, over the next hour till my upgrade room was ready; Complimentary Rooms for early-check-ins are offered by all Kimpton Hotels in case a room isn't yet ready, and also informally offered by a few Hotel Indigos.

I accepted his offer, and as he handed me the keys to the temporary room, an amazingly resourceful front desk clerk named Megan, who'd apparently overheard us and had decided to tackle the issue decisively, strode over, explained that she'd managed to get an upgrade room on an upper floor readied  for me, and handed me my room key packet.

I was quite amazed by Megan's resourcefulness, and also by Zach's helpful attitude. BTW, since we had traded business cards, Zach stayed in touch with me via email throughout my stay to ensure that my stay was flawless.

-- In my reviews, I rarely mention staffers by name to compliment them, if only because I have a really poor memory for names, but I find that I must once again mention the front desk staffer named Megan, b/c in each of my subsequent interactions with her, she proved to be extremely helpful, alert, competent, resourceful and professional; I must admit that I am very impressed!
 
-- Overall, a great Hotel Indigo! I will definitely stay here again on any future visits to Madison!

1029,5,0,"I have been staying at the Hotel Indigo almost weekly over the past three months. I have to say I really look forward to visiting this hotel, not only for the immaculate rooms and excellent dining options, but more so for the wonderful hospitality received from the Front Desk and Valet staff. Upon each arrival, I'm greeted by name and a sincere hello. Alex is frequently managing the desk when I arrive. Without fail, he works to exceed expectations and ensures I am set for my stay. He goes above and beyond to make sure my visit is comfortable. When one is constantly traveling for work, it is a special thing to find employees that make a hotel feel like home.

1032,3,0,"Stayed a week in one of the large suites. It's an excellent location and has a very good restaurant. The staff is very friendly. You need to valet your car which becomes expensive but it's convenient and easy.  The room was very nice, roomy with a large two sink/two shower bathroom. Bed was comfortable. Our only complaint was the air conditioning. It sounded like tennis shoes in the dryer. Very, very loud noise and vibration. We couldn't hear the TV and it woke you up at night. We reported it to the front desk five straight days and nothing. The valet and one of our waitress's asked about our stay and we told them about the A/C. Every time we saw them over the course of the week they asked if it had been fixed or had they offered us another room. They couldn't believe they hadn't moved us. When checking out the girl asked about our stay. When we told her, we got the standard ""sorry about that"" answer. My wife and I just laughed. Hotel was great but I marked them down for their failure to respond to a major issue.",Hotel Indigo Madison Downtown,901 E Washington Ave,53703,5.0,"{'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2'}","Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services"
1033,5,2,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a wedding block and everything about our stay was excellent. The location is great and was easy to find. Valet parking was easy, although we probably would have been fine if there was a non-valet option (there isn't one if you want to park at the hotel). Check in was easy and the concierge was very friendly. The room was excellent and the bed was very comfortable. Overall it was more pricey than the hotels we would normally choose but was definitely worth it and an excellent stay.",Hotel Indigo Madison Downtown,901 E Washington Ave,53703,5.0,"{'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2'}","Venues & Event Spaces, Hotels & Travel, Hotels, Event Planning & Services"
1034,5,0,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Indigo. They had only been open for 8 days when I checked in and if they hadn't mentioned it, I would have had no idea. They had it together from check-in to dining to valet parking. The hotel itself is super modern and beautiful. It's in a great location, really close to a lot of bars and restaurants. I brought my dog with me and they were all so sweet to her with lots of pets and treats. The area is very walkable for those thinking about bringing their pooch. It was a rainy while I was there, so I ended up eating in the hotel restaurant both nights. The food was fantastic. The bleu wedge salad was to die for and the salmon was delish. The cocktails were fun also and I liked the street view from the bar. I've been enthusiastically recommending this hotel to my coworkers next time they have to go to Madison.

1035,5,1,"This was one of the coolest hotels I've stayed at. It is all paint and art themed with modern contemporary furniture and style. The staff was very nice and helpful, the shuttle takes you anywhere within 3 miles as well. It was very clean and welcoming. A short walk to the capital building and UW campus with tons of shops and restaurants.
