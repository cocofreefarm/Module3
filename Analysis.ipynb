       "1 I stayed here twice in a short period of time in April 2014.  The first time I liked it, the second time made me join the Hilton Hhonors program and recuse myself from Marriott for a while.  I requested connecting rooms (traveling with my son and one of my parents each time).  The first time we got that, the second time we did not.  Disappointing, but it was more the way the woman checking us in clearly could not care less that my son couldn't stay near his Nana--good acting is the key to good customer service.  The second time we stayed the heat was very loud, which I didn't figure out until my son was asleep so no way to get it fixed (assuming they'd care more about that issue).  I don't much understand why housekeeping couldn't have filled out a note that the heat was broken--it was LOUD, they would have noticed.  The bathroom was very small, very.  \\nBut it was clean, the pool area was nice (although had not been cleaned during the night when we went down the next morning).  Breakfast was fine, nothing special.  I won't be staying here again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2 Our room on the second floor was very nice. The decor is Victorian, from the furniture to the color palette, even down to the little octagonal black and white tiles in the bathroom. There was a lovely fireplace, and the toilet tank was mounted by the ceiling with a pull chain to flush.\\nThere was a small sitting area and full sink, countertop and mini fridge, a full sized coffee maker and a small flat screen TV. The mattress was comfortable, the towels were soft and there was good water pressure in the shower.\\nWe stayed in the winter and the room was toasty warm.\\nFrom our room you could hear the traffic noise, especially due to the wet roads, and the room is above a bar. From the bathroom we could hear distant voices, maybe from the bar or from an adjoining room, but it wasn't a problem. I could hear people walking in their room on third floor a couple of times.\\nThe thing that was a surprise as far as noise were the trains that went through in the wee hours of the morning. We had arrived after dark and didn't notice that a railway crossing was right outside our window one story down, and at least twice trains went by and blew their horns a few toots as they passed the intersection.\\nWe had some drinks, including complimentary ones for our stay, at the Up North, and the bartender told us we could take drinks and popcorn up to the room if we would like.\\nThe Hotel Ruby Marie was a charming stay and I would stay again if I were looking to spend some time in the area.\n",

       "5 I throughly enjoyed my stay in this very neat historical building. Id prefer to be able to rate with half stars simply because it deserves 4.5. The only reason not giving 5, is because we couldn't adjust the heat in the room and it was so hot we had to open all the windows because there is no concierge after 7pm. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful, fast and excellent service. I would absolutely stay again but ideally a different room with climate control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "6 Ok, so I chose this place because I love old, and quirky, and full of history and kindness, and in all these aspects I was not disappointed. This lovely creepy cool old hotel was perfectly clean and there were little shared porches, and the bed was comfy, and the bathroom was recently renovated, and the long blood red hallways were hung with vintage photos of horrifyingly judgmental looking Victorians. All of this I enjoy a great deal. The staff were all super nice. \\n\\nWhere it all broke down for me was first, the noise. It sounded like ghosts were cranking machines in all the walls of my bedroom and the machines were full of water and rusty metal and crumbling cement, and it happened all night while the heat swooped from sweaty hot to icy hand of death cold. On the second day I was there the wifi went down, and I weirdly couldn't get phone calls or texts as well, and when I tried to call the front desk the phone in my room didn't work. \\n\\nI chalk this all up to ghosts and history and character, and it wasn't a huge problem, but I'd hesitate before I chose this place again. I loved the location across from the lake and I loved the fresh free pastries downstairs, and I loved the sweet dive bar attached to the hotel. I'm so torn. Did I mention the staff were super nice?                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
